Common Stock into which the Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series D

Preferred Stock is convertible, as hereinafter provided.

The right of conversion with respect to any shares of Preferred Stock which shall have

shares of Common Stock at the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C-
1 Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series D Conversion Price, Series E Conversion
Price or Series F Conversion Price, as the case may be, then in effect upon the closing of a firm
commitment underwritten public offering led by an investment banking firm acceptable to the
holders of two-thirds of the then outstanding Series E Preferred Stock, Series D Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer
and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation to the public at an offering price
per share of not less than $9.42 per share (as adjusted to reflect any stock dividends,
distributions, combinations, reclassifications or other like transactions effected by the
Corporation in respect of its Common Stock) and with gross proceeds to the Corporation of not
less than $50,000,000 (prior to underwriters’ discounts and commissions) (a “Qualified [PO”) (in
the event of which offering, the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted the Preferred
Stock until the closing of such offering). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Preferred
Stock shall be subject to automatic conversion pursuant to this Section 2(b)(i) in connection with
an underwritten public offering that otherwise meets the requirements of this Section 2(b)(i) (x)
at an offering price per share that is between $3.70 and $9.42 (as adjusted to reflect any stock
dividends, distributions, combinations, reclassifications or other like transactions effected by the
Corporation in respect of its Common Stock), if the holders of at least two-thirds of the then
outstanding Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series D Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, shall have
consented to such automatic conversion; or (y) at an offering price per share that is less than
$3.70 (as adjusted to reflect any stock dividends, distributions, combinations, reclassifications or
other like transactions effected by the Corporation in respect of its Common Stock), if the
holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a
separate class, and the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the then outstanding Series C
Preferred Stock, Series D Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock, voting
together as a single class, shall have consented to such automatic conversion.

Gi) In addition to the requirements of Section 2(b)(i), but subject to
Section 2(b)(iii), in connection with an underwritten public offering not otherwise meeting the
requirements of Section 2(b)(i), each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock,
Series C-1 Stock, Series C Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series
F Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted effective upon and subject to the closing of
such firm commitment underwritten public offering into shares of Common Stock at the Series A
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C-1 Conversion Price, Series C Conversion
Price, Series D Conversion Price, Series E Conversion Price and Series F Conversion Price then
in effect, as the case may be, upon the written election of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
then outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D
Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, to
require such mandatory conversion.

(iii) | Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 2(b)(i) and 2(b)(ii), in
any conversion of the Series E Preferred pursuant to Section 2(b)(i) or 2(b)(ii) effective upon and

28664817_9

subject to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering in which the offering
price per share at which shares of Common Stock are sold in the offering (the “Public Offering
Price Per Share”) is less than $9.42 (as adjusted to reflect stock splits, stock dividends, stock
combinations, recapitalizations or like occurrences, including any such occurrences to be
effected in connection with such offering), each share of Series E Preferred outstanding
immediately prior to such closing shall be convertible into a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the greater of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock such share of Series E
Preferred is then convertible into as of such date pursuant to the other provisions of this Section
2 and (y) the quotient obtained by dividing the Special Series E Liquidation Payment calculated
as if the date of such underwritten public offering was the date of liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation (as adjusted to reflect stock splits, stock dividends, stock
combinations, recapitalizations or like occurrences, including any such occurrences to be
effected in connection with such offering) by the Public Offering Price Per Share, rounded up to
the nearest one-tenth of a share (for example, if the Public Offering Price Per Share is $5.00 at a
time when the Special Series E Liquidation Payment is $7.00, then each share of Series E
Preferred would, under clause (y) above, be convertible into 1.4 shares of Common Stock ($7.00
+ $5.00 = 1.4)).

(c) Mechanics of Automatic Conversions. Upon the occurrence of an event
specified in Subsection 2(b), the shares of the applicable series of Preferred Stock shall be
converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or
not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer
agent; provided, however, that all holders of shares of Preferred Stock being converted shall be
given written notice of the occurrence of the event specified in Subsection 2(b) triggering such
conversion, including the date such event occurred (the “Mandatory Conversion Date”), and the
Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion unless certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock
being converted are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, or the holder notifies
the Corporation or any transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed
and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from
any loss incurred by it in connection therewith. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all rights
with respect to the applicable series of Preferred Stock so converted shall terminate, except any
of the rights of the holder thereof, upon surrender of the holder’s certificate or certificates
therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which such series
of Preferred Stock has been converted, including after giving effect to the provisions of
Subsection 2(b)(iii), together with cash in an amount equal to all dividends declared but unpaid
on, and any and all other amounts owing with respect to, the shares of Preferred Stock converted
to and including the time of conversion. Upon the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock,
the holders of such Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates representing such shares at the
office of the Corporation or of its transfer agent. If so required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or by the holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. Upon surrender of such certificates
there shall be issued and delivered to such holder, or to such holder’s nominee or nominees
promptly at such office, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
into which the shares of Preferred Stock surrendered were convertible on the date on which such

10

28664817_9

automatic conversion occurred, together with cash in an amount equal to all dividends declared
but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts owing with respect to, the shares of Preferred Stock
converted to and including the time of conversion. Upon the automatic conversion of the
Preferred Stock, all shares of Preferred Stock being converted by any holder thereof shall be
aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of Common Stock to which such
holder shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock shall be issued. In lieu of any
fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash
equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the Common Stock on the
Mandatory Conversion Date, as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.

(d) Mechanics of Optional Conversions. Before any holder of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that the holder
elects to convert the same and shall state therein the holder’s name or the name or names of the
holder’s nominees in which the holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock to be issued. On the date of conversion, all rights with respect to the Preferred Stock so
converted shal! terminate, except any of the rights of the holder thereof, upon surrender of the
holder’s certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted and cash in an amount equal
to all dividends declared but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts owing with respect to, the
shares of Preferred Stock being converted to and including the time of conversion. If so required
by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or by the holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. Upon
the optional conversion of the Preferred Stock, all shares of Preferred Stock being converted by
any holder thereof shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock
shal] be issued. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled,
the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the date of conversion, as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors in
good faith. The Corporation shall, promptly after surrender of the certificate or certificates for
conversion, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the holder’s
nominee or nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which the holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a
share and cash in an amount equal to all dividends declared but unpaid thereon and any and all
other amounts owing with respect thereto at such time. Unless otherwise specified by the holder
in the written notice of conversion, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock on such date.

(I) In the case of Convertible Securities or Options
for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the
consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or
not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or

14

Options or Convertible Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment
previously made in the Series F Conversion Price, Series E Conversion Price, Series D

than the Series F Conversion Price, Series E Conversion Price, Series D Conversion Price, Series
C Conversion Price, Series C-1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A

(2) —_In the event that at any time or from time to time after the
Series E Original] Issue Date, the Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock
(including, without limitation, Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued
pursuant to Subsection 2(e){iii)(1) but excluding Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to
be issued pursuant to Subsection 2(e)(iti)(2), which event is dealt with in Subsection 2(e)(vi)(1)),
without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series E Conversion Price in
effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, such Series E
Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to the consideration per share
received by the Corporation for such issue or deemed issue of the Additional Shares of Common
Stock; provided that if such issuance or deemed issuance was without consideration, then the
Corporation shall be deemed to have received an aggregate of $.001 of consideration for all such
Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued; provided further, that, if
pursuant to Subsection 2(e)(iti)(1)(C) no Additional Shares of Common Stock upon which an
adjustment had been previously made are deemed to have been issued, then the Series E
Conversion Price shall be recalculated to negate the effect of any adjustment made upon any
previous deemed issuance of such Additional Shares of Common Stock; and provided, further,
that if such issuance or deemed issuance occurs after a Bona Fide Financing, the adjustment set

the holders of two-thirds (2/3) of the Series E Preferred Stock in their reasonable discretion,
regardless of the amount of securities issued to such strategic investor in such transaction or
transactions, as applicable.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Subsection 2(e),
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common
Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amounts of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are
issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been

issued pursuant to Subsection 2(e)(iti)(1), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing (x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the

Conversion Price, Series E Conversion Price, Series D Conversion Price, Series C Conversion
Price, Series C-1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price and Series A Conversion Price in
effect immediately before such deemed issuance shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of
such deemed issuance, be proportionately decreased.

Price, Series B Conversion Price and Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to
such combination or consolidation shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination
or consolidation, be proportionately increased.

time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Corporation shall make or issue, or fix

a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common Stock or
securities the issuance of which are deemed to be issuances of Common Stock under Subsection
2(e)(iil), then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred
Stock shal] receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common
Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Corporation that they would have
received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such
event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the
conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period,
giving application during such period to all adjustments called for herein.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, or Substitution. In the event that
at any time or from time to time after the applicable Original Issue Date the Common Stock

issuable upon the conversion of the applicable Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or

whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise (other than a
subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend provided for above, or a merger,
consolidation, or sale of assets provided for below), then and in each such event the holder of
any shares of the applicable Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares
into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon
such reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other change by the holder of a number
of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such
shares of the applicable Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or change, all subject to further adjustment as
provided herein.

provisions of Subsection 1(c), in the event that, at any time or from time to time after the

applicable Original Issue Date, the Corporation shall merge or consolidate with or into another
entity or sell all or substantially ail of its assets, and such consolidation, merger or sale is not
treated as a liquidation under Subsection 1(c), each share of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be
convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property to which a
holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon
conversion of such Preferred Stock would have been entitled to receive upon such consolidation,
merger or sale; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions set forth in this Section 2
with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the holders of shares of such Preferred Stock,
to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 2 (including provisions with respect to
changes in and other adjustments of the Series F Conversion Price, Series E Conversion Price,
Series D Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price, Series C-1 Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price and Series A Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as
reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other securities or property thereafter

(i) Special Mandatory Conversion.

(i) In the event that any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Stock, Series D Stock, Series E Preferred Stock or Series F
Preferred Stock does not participate in a Qualified Financing (as defined below) by purchasing in
the aggregate, in such Qualified Financing and within the time period specified by the
Corporation (provided that the Corporation has given such holder at least ten (10) days prior
written notice of the Qualified Financing), such holder’s Pro Rata Amount (as defined below),
then the Applicable Portion (as defined below) of the shares of Preferred Stock held by such
holder shall automatically, and without any further action on the part of such holder, be
converted into shares of Common Stock at the applicable Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the consummation of such Qualified Financing,
effective upon, subject to, and concurrently with, the consummation of the Qualified Financing.
For purposes of determining the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned by a holder, and for
determining the number of Offered Securities a holder of Preferred Stock has purchased in a
Qualified Financing, all shares of Preferred Stock held by Affiliates (as defined below) of such
holder shall be aggregated with such holder’s shares of Preferred Stock and all Offered Securities
purchased by Affiliates of such holder shall be aggregated with the Offered Securities (as defined
below) purchased by such holder (provided that no shares or securities shall be attributed to more
than one entity or person within any such group of affiliated entities or persons). Any such
conversion is sometimes hereinafter referred to as a “Special Mandatory Conversion.”

(ii) Upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, each holder of shares of
Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 2(i)(i) shall surrender his, her or its certificate or
certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall
thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Section 2(i) and a new certificate for the number of shares, if any, of

20
28664817_9

Preferred Stock represented by such surrendered certificate and not converted pursuant to
Section 2(i)(i). If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be
endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to
the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by the holder’s attorney duly
authorized in writing. All rights with respect to the Preferred Stock converted pursuant to
Section 2(i)(i) shall terminate, except any of the rights of the holder thereof, upon surrender of
the holder’s certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted, together with cash in an
amount equal to all dividends declared but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts owing with
respect to, the shares of Preferred Stock converted to and including the time of conversion, and a
new certificate for the number of shares, if any, of Preferred Stock represented by such
surrendered certificate and not converted pursuant to Section 2(i)(i). Upon the conversion of
shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2(i)(i), all shares of Preferred Stock of any holder
thereof shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of Common
Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock shall be
issued. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the
Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the date of such conversion, as reasonably determined by the Board of
Directors in good faith.

(iii) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are
required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from
and after the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have been retired and
cancelled, and the shares of Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 2(i)(i) represented
thereby shall, from and after the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have
been converted into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or

outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock in three equal annual installments, upon the terms
set forth in this Section 6 (the date of each installment being referred to as a “Series F
Redemption Date”). On each Series F Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a pro
rata basis in accordance with the number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock owned by each
holder, that number of outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i)
the total number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
Series F Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Series F Redemption Dates (including
the Series F Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). On each such Series F
Redemption Date, the holders of Series F Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificate or
certificates for the shares to be redeemed duly endorsed for transfer or with duly executed stock
transfer powers sufficient to permit transfer attached, at the offices of the Corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Series F Preferred Stock. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable

shares not being redeemed. The redemption price per share of Series F Preferred Stock, shall be

the Series F Preferred Stock) (the “Series F Base Redemption Price”) plus all dividends accrued
or declared but unpaid on such share on the applicable Series F Redemption Date plus (ii) an
additional amount computed like interest payable on the Series F Base Redemption Price at the
rate equal to simple interest of ten percent (10%) per annum from the date of issuance of such
share of Series F Preferred Stock. If the funds of the Corporation legally available for
redemption of the Series F Preferred Stock are insufficient to redeem the number of shares of
Series F Preferred Stock required under this Subsection 6(a) to be redeemed on such date from
the holders of the Series F Preferred Stock, those funds which are legally available will be used,
to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares of Series F Preferred Stock. To the
extent any shares of Series F Preferred Stock are not redeemed on the applicable Series F
Redemption Date, the Corporation shall promptly return (or issue replacement certificates) any
surrendered certificate or certificates to the record holder of such Series F Preferred Stock. At

29
28664817_9

any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation become legally available for the
redemption of Series F Preferred Stock, such funds will be used to redeem the maximum number
of additional shares of Series F Preferred Stock which the Corporation was theretofore obligated
to redeem, on the basis set forth in the preceding sentence.

(b) Series E Redemption. If at any time following the redemption in full of all
shares of Series F Preferred Stock subject to a redemption request, the Corporation receives the

anniversary of the Original Issue Date of the Series F Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall be
required to redeem all, but not less than all, of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock
in three equal annual installments, upon the terms set forth in this Section 6 (the date of each
installment being referred to as a “Series E Redemption Date”). On each Series E Redemption
Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of shares
of Series E Preferred Stock owned by each holder, that number of outstanding shares of Series E
Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such Series E Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining
Series E Redemption Dates (including the Series E Redemption Date to which such calculation
applies). On each such Series E Redemption Date, the holders of Series E Preferred Stock shall
surrender the certificate or certificates for the shares to be redeemed duly endorsed for transfer or
with duly executed stock transfer powers sufficient to permit transfer attached, at the offices of
the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Series E Preferred Stock. The Corporation shall,
as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to each holder a certificate or certificates for
the balance of the shares not being redeemed. The redemption price per share of Series E
Preferred Stock, shall be equal to (i) $3.14 for the Series E Preferred Stock (which amount shall
be adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, reclassification or other
similar event with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock) (the “Series E Base Redemption
Price’) plus all dividends accrued or declared but unpaid on such share on the applicable Series
E Redemption Date plus (ii) an additional amount computed like interest payable on the Series E
Base Redemption Price at the rate equal to simple interest of ten percent (10%) per annum from
the date of issuance of such share of Series E Preferred Stock. Subject to Subsection 6(a), if the
funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of the Series E Preferred Stock are
insufficient to redeem the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock required under this
Subsection 6(b) to be redeemed on such date from the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock,
those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of
such shares of Series E Preferred Stock. To the extent any shares of Series E Preferred Stock are
not redeemed on the applicable Series E Redemption Date, the Corporation shall promptly return
(or issue replacement certificates) any surrendered certificate or certificates to the record holder
of such Series E Preferred Stock. Subject to Subsection 6(a), at any time thereafter when
additional funds of the Corporation become legally available for the redemption of Series E
Preferred Stock, such funds will be used to redeem the maximum number of additional shares of
Series E Preferred Stock which the Corporation was theretofore obligated to redeem, on the basis
set forth in the preceding sentence.

with the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock owned by each holder, that number of
outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total number of
shares of Series D Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Series D Redemption
Date by (ii) the number of remaining Series D Redemption Dates (including the Series D
Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). On each such Series D Redemption Date,
the holders of Series D Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates for the shares
to be redeemed duly endorsed for transfer or with duly executed stock transfer powers sufficient
to permit transfer attached, at the offices of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Series
D Preferred Stock. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to
each holder a certificate or certificates for the balance of the shares not being redeemed. The
redemption price per share of Series D Preferred Stock, shall be equal to (i) $3.14 for the Series
D Preferred Stock (which amount, in each case, shall be adjusted for any stock dividend, stock
split, combination of shares, reclassification or other similar event with respect to the Series D
Preferred Stock) (the “Series D Base Redemption Price”) plus all dividends accrued or declared
but unpaid on such share on the applicable Series D Redemption Date plus (ti) an additional
amount computed like interest payable on the Series D Base Redemption Price at the rate equal
to simple interest of ten percent (10%) per annum from the date of issuance of such share of
Series D Preferred Stock. Subject to Subsections 6(a) and 6(b), tf the funds of the Corporation
legally available for redemption of the Series D Preferred Stock are insufficient to redeem the
number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock required under this Subsection 6(c) to be redeemed
on such date from the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock, those funds which are legally
available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares of Series D
Preferred Stock. To the extent any shares of Series D Preferred Stock are not redeemed on the
applicable Series D Redemption Date, the Corporation shall promptly return (or issue
replacement certificates) any surrendered certificate or certificates to the record holder of such
Series D Preferred Stock. Subject to Subsections 6(a) and 6(b), at any time thereafter when
additional funds of the Corporation become legally available for the redemption of Series D
Preferred Stock, such funds will be used to redeem the maximum number of additional shares of
Series D Preferred Stock which the Corporation was theretofore obligated to redeem, on the
basis set forth in the preceding sentence.

(d) Series C Redemption. If at any time following the redemption in full of all
shares of Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock subject
to a redemption request, the Corporation receives written election of holders of at least two-
thirds of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock made at any time on or after the date
that is 90 days before the fifth anniversary of the Original Issue Date of the Series F Preferred
Stock, the Corporation shall be required to redeem all, but not less than al], of the outstanding
shares of Series C Preferred Stock in three equal annual installments, upon the terms set forth in

On each Series C Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata basis in
accordance with the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock owned by each holder, that
number of outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total
number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Series C
Redemption Date by (11) the number of remaining Series C Redemption Dates (including the
Series C Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). On each such Series C
Redemption Date, the holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificate or
certificates for the shares to be redeemed duly endorsed for transfer or with duly executed stock

legally available for redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock are insufficient to redeem the

(h) If, on or before a redemption date, the funds necessary for such redemption
shall have been set aside by the Corporation and deposited with a bank or trust company, in trust
for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the Preferred Stock that has been called for redemption,
then, notwithstanding that any certificates for shares that have been called for redemption shall
not have been surrendered for cancellation, the shares represented thereby shall no longer be
deemed outstanding from and after such redemption date, and all rights of holders of such shares
so called for redemption shall forthwith, after such redemption date, cease and terminate with
respect to such shares, excepting only the right to receive the redemption funds therefor to which
they are entitled. Any interest accrued on funds so deposited and unclaimed by stockholders
entitled thereto shall be paid to such stockholders at the time their respective shares are redeemed
or to the Corporation at the time unclaimed amounts are paid to it. In case the holders of shares
of Preferred Stock which shall have been called for redemption shall not, within one year after
the final redemption date, claim the amounts so deposited with respect to the redemption thereof,
any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed
amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company shall be relieved of all responsibility in
respect thereof to such holder and such holder shall look only to the Corporation for the payment
thereof. Any funds so deposited with a bank or trust company which shall not be required for
such redemption by reason of the exercise subsequent to the date of such deposit of the right of
conversion of any shares or otherwise shall be returned to the Corporation forthwith.

(i) If the Corporation for any reason fails to redeem any of the shares of Preferred
Stock in accordance with Subsection 6(a), 6(b), 6(c), 6(d), 6(e) or 6(f) on or prior to the

become obligated to pay, in addition to the total redemption price specified in Subsections 6(a),
6(b), 6(c), 6(d), 6(e) or 6(f), interest on the unpaid balance of such price, which shall accrue at a
rate equal to the lesser of (i) one percent (1%) per month or (ii) the maximum interest rate
allowable under applicable law, until such price is paid in full.

the Corporation by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued,
and all such shares shall be canceled, retired and eliminated from the shares which the
