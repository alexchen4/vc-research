(i) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to convert shares of

Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or

-9-
USIDOCS 6294257¥3

certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock, at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred
Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer
agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the
shares of Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates. Such notice shall state .
such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or his or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The date of receipt of such certificates
and notice by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own
transfer agent) shall be the conversion date (“Conversion Date”). The Corporation shall, as soon
as practicable after the Conversion Date, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
Preferred Stock, or to his or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction
of ashare. The person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock
as of the Conversion Date.

(ii) | The Corporation shall at all times when the Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
outstanding Preferred Stock. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
reducing the Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price,
Series B-1 Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price below the
then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock,
the Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its legal counsel, be
necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series B-1 Conversion Price, Series C Conversion
Price or Series D Conversion Price.

(iii) | Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Series A

declared but unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D
Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

(iv) All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered
for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with
respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote as a holder of
Preferred Stock, shall immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date, except only the
right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and
payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Preferred Stock so
converted shall be retired and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and the Corporation (without

the need for stockholder action) may from time to time take such appropriate action as may be
necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

(v) The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes that
may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in
the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the
shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be
made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation
the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax
has been paid.

Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price, as applicable,
pursuant to this Subsection 4(d), shall be made as a result of any issuance or deemed issuance of
Additional Shares of Common Stock if: (a) the consideration per share (determined pursuant to

by the Corporation is equal to or greater than the applicable Series A Conversion Price, Series A-
1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D
Conversion Price, as the case may be, in effect immediately prior to such issuance or deemed
issuance of such Additional Shares, or (b) prior to such issuance or deemed issuance, the
Corporation receives, as applicable, the written consent from the holders of (i) at least 60% of the
then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock with respect to an issuance or deemed

to an issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock that otherwise would
adjust the Series D Conversion Price, in each case agreeing that no such adjustment shall be
made as the result of such issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(iii) Issue of Securities Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common
Stock. If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall
issue any Options (excluding Options covered by Subsection 4(d)(i)(D)(I), IV and (V) above) or
Convertible Securities (excluding Convertible Securities covered by subsection 4(d)(i)(D)(1)
above) or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities
entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of
shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any
vesting or similar limitation or any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities
and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be
deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case
such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided
that Additional Shares of Common Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued unless the
consideration per share (determined pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(v) hereof) of such Additional
Shares of Common Stock would be less than the applicable Series A Conversion Price, Series A-
1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D
Conversion Price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, or such record

-13-

USIDOCS 6294257¥3

date, as the case may be, and provided further that in any such case in which Additional Shares
of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:

(A) No further adjustment in the Series A Conversion Price,
Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D
Conversion Price shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of
Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities;

(B) If such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Series A
Conversion Price, Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion
Price or Series D Conversion Price, as applicable, computed upon the original issue thereof (or
upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based
thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect
such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or
exchange under such Convertible Securities;

(C) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
Option, the affected Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price shall be readjusted to
the Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C
Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price, as the case may be, that would be in effect had
such Option never been issued, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed issued as
the result of the original issue of such Option shall not be deemed issued for the purposes of any
subsequent adjustment of the affected Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1 Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price;

(D) In the event of any change in the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or
Convertible Security, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the anti-dilution
provisions thereof, the Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price then in effect shal]
forthwith be readjusted to such Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price, as the case may be,
as would have obtained had the adjustment which was made upon the issuance of such Option or
Convertible Security not exercised or converted prior to such change been made upon the basis
of such change; and

(E) No readjustment pursuant to clause (B), (C) or (D) above
shall have the effect of increasing the Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1 Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price to an amount
which exceeds the lower of (i) the Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1 Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price, as
applicable, on the original adjustment date, or (ii) the Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion

-14-
USIDOCS 6294257v3

Price, as applicable, that would have resulted from any issuances of Additional Shares of
Common Stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

In the event the Corporation, after the Origina] Issue Date, amends the terms of any such
Options or Convertible Securities (whether such Options or Convertible Securities were
outstanding on the Original Issue Date or were issued after the Original Issue Date), then such
Options or Convertible Securities, as so amended, shall be deemed to have been issued after the
Original Issue Date and the provisions of this Subsection 4(d)(ili) shall apply.

(iv) Adjustment of Senes A Conversion Price, Series A-] Conversion
Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price and Senes D Conversion Price
Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shal! at any
time after the Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including
Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii), but
excluding shares issued as a stock split or combination as provided in Subsection 4(e) or upon a
dividend or distribution as provided in Subsection 4(f)), without consideration or fora
consideration per share less than the applicable Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1}
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, such Series A Conversion
Price, Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or
Series D Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a
price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Series A Conversion Price,
Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D
Conversion Price, as the case may be, by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which shall be (1) the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue (calculated
assuming conversion of all issued and outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise,
exchange or conversion of all then outstanding options, warrants or subscription rights) plus
(2) the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received or to be
received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so
issued would purchase at such then existing Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1 Conversion
Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price, as the
case may be; and (B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issue (calculated assuming conversion of all issued and
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise, exchange or conversion of all then
outstanding options, warrants or subscription rights) plus the total number of such Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued; provided that, the number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issuable upon exercise or conversion of such outstanding Options and Convertible
Securities shall not give effect to any adjustments to the conversion price or conversion rate of
such Options or Convertible Securities resulting from the issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock that is the subject of this calculation.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this
Subsection 4(d), the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(A) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

-15-

US1IDOCS 6294257¥3

(1)

(II)

(IH)

insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate of cash received by the Corporation,
excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued
interest; -

insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair market value thereof at the
time of such issue, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors; and

in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock
are issued together with other shares or securities or
other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (I) and (II) above, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Subsection 4(d)(iii), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be

determined by dividing:

(1)

(If)

USIDOCS 6294257v3

the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Corporation as consideration for the issue of
such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the
minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any vesting or
similar limitation or any provision contained therein
for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration)
payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of
such Options or the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for
Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options
for Convertible Securities and the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, by

the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
(as set forth in the instruments relating thereto.
without regard to any vesting or similar limitation
or any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) issuable upon the
exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities,

-16-

(vi) Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock which are comprised of shares of the

same series or class of Preferred Stock, and such issuance dates occur within a period of no more
than 120 days, then, upon the final such issuance, the Series A Conversion Price, Series A-]
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion
Price, as the case may be, shall be adjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred
on the date of the final such issuance (and without giving effect to any adjustments as a result of
such prior issuances within such period).

(e) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation shall at
any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price, Series B-1 Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D
Conversion Price then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately
decreased. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date
combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series B-1 Conversion Price, Series C Conversion
Price or Series D Conversion Price then in effect immediately before the combination shall be
proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this paragraph shall become effective at the
close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(f Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or
fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a
dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each
such event the Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion
Price, Series B-1 Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price and Series D Conversion Price
then in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance
or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such
record date, by multiplying the Series A Conversion Price, the Series A-1 Conversion Price, the
Series B Conversion Price, the Series B-1 Conversion Price, the Series C Conversion Price or the
Series D Conversion Price, as the case may be, then in effect by a fraction:

(i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date (calculated assuming conversion of issued and outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise, exchange or conversion of all then outstanding
options, warrants or subscription rights), and

(ii) | the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date (calculated assuming conversion of issued and outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise, exchange or conversion of all then outstanding
options, warrants or subscription rights) plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in
payment of such dividend or distribution; provided, however, if such record date shall have been
fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed
therefor, the Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on

-17-

USIDOCS 6294257v3

such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph
as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and provided further,
however, that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock simultaneously
receive (i) a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the
number of shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event or (ii) a
dividend or other distribution of shares of Preferred Stock which are convertible, as of the date of
such event, into such number of shares of Common Stock as is equal to the number of additional
shares of Common Stock being issued with respect to each share of Common Stock in such
dividend or distribution.

(g) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or
fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a
dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of
Common Stock, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of
Preferred Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of
Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Corporation that they
would have received had the Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of
such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including
the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period,
giving application to all adjustments called for during such period under this paragraph with
respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock; and provided further, however, that no
such adjustment shall be made if the holders of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a
dividend or other distribution of such securities in an amount equal to the amount of such
securities as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

(h) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, or Substitution. If at any time
or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares
of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise
(other than a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend provided for above, or a
reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale of assets provided for below), then and in each
such event the holder of each such share of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to
convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property
receivable, upon such reorganization, reclassification, or other change, by holders of the number
of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock might have been
converted immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification, or change, all subject to
further adjustment as provided herein.

(i) Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions
of Subsection 2(c), if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the
Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than
a transaction covered by paragraphs (e), (f) (g) or (h) of this Section 4), then, following any such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Preferred

-18-

US1DOCS 6294257v3

Stock shall be convertible into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a
holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of
one share of Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such
transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this

Section 4 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Preferred Stock,
to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to
changes in and other adjustments of the Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1 Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price, Series B-1 Conversion Price and Series C Conversion Price) shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly equivalent as reasonably may be determined, in relation to any
securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock.

(j) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Series A Conversion Price, Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price, Series B-1 Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D
Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to
each holder of Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock,
Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, as the case
may be, a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts
upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the written
request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such
holder a certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (1i) the Series A
Conversion Price, Series A-1 Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series B-|
Conversion Price, Series C Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price, as the case may be,
then in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other
property which then would be received upon the conversion of each series of Preferred Stock.

(k) Notice of Record Date. In the event:

(i) that the Corporation declares a dividend (or any other distribution)
on its Common Stock payable in Common Stock or other securities of the Corporation;

(ii) that the Corporation subdivides or combines its outstanding shares
of Common Stock;

(ili) of any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation
(other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding shares of Common Stock or a stock
dividend or stock distribution thereon), or of any consolidation or merger of the Corporation into
or with another corporation, or of the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation; or

(iv) of a Liquidation Event; then the Corporation shall use reasonable
efforts to cause to be filed at its principal office or at the office of the transfer agent of the
Preferred Stock, and shall cause to be mailed to the holders of the Preferred Stock at their last
addresses as shown on the records of the Corporation or such transfer agent, at least ten days

US1DOCS 629425743

prior to the date specified in (A) below or twenty days before the date specified in (B) below, a
notice stating

(A) _ the record date of such dividend, distribution, subdivision
or combination, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common
Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination are to be
determined, or

(B) _ the date on which such reclassification, consolidation,
merger, sale or Liquidation Event is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is
expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of
Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification,
consolidation, merger, sale or Liquidation Event; provided, however, that the Corporation's
failure to provide any notice required under this Section 4(!) after using reasonable efforts shall
not be deemed a default, breach or violation of this Section 4(1).

5. Mandatory Conversion.

(a) Upon (i) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock, at a price to
the public of at least $8.00 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment for stock splits, stock
dividends, combinations, recapitalizations and other similar events affecting such shares), in a
firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least $40,000,000 of proceeds (after
deducting underwriter discounts and commissions) to the Corporation and the listing of such
securities on either the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Global Market (a
“Qualifying Public Offering”) or (ii) a vote or written consent of the holders of 66 2/3% of the
then outstanding shares of Senior Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class (each, a
“Mandatory Conversion Date”), (A) all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall automatically
be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the then effective Series A Conversion Price,
Series A-] Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price, Series B-1 Conversion Price, Series C
Conversion Price or Series D Conversion Price, as the case may be, and (B) the number of
authorized shares of Preferred Stock shall be automatically reduced by the number of shares of
Preferred Stock that had been designated as Preferred Stock and all provisions for the Preferred
Stock and all references to the Series A Preferred Stock, Series A-} Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred
Stock shall be deleted and shall be of no further force or effect. Notwithstanding the above, and
with respect to Series D Preferred Stock only, in no event shall the conversion of shares of
Series D Preferred Stock be effected without the vote or written consent of the holders of at least
71% of the then outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock other than (i) pursuant to a
Qualifying Public Offering or (ii) pursuant to and in connection with a Liquidation Event in
which the Liquidation Proceeds are either (A) less than the Liquidation Trigger but such amount
which would result in holders of Series D Preferred Stock receiving in such Liquidation Event an
amount equal to or greater than $6.56063 per share of Series D Preferred Stock or (B) greater
than or equal to an amount which would result in holders of Series D Preferred Stock receiving
in such Liquidation Event an amount equal to or greater than $9.840945 per share of Series D

(b) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be given written
notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory conversion of
all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such notice need not be given in
advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Date. Such notice shall be sent by first
class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to each record holder of Preferred Stock at such
holder’s address last shown on the records of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or the
records of the Corporation, if it serves as its own transfer agent). Upon receipt of such notice,
each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his or its certificate or certificates for all
such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to this Section 5. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all rights with respect to the Preferred
Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a
holder of Common Stock) will terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon
surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of
shares of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted, and payment of
any declared but unpaid dividends thereon. If so required by the Corporation, certificates
surrendered for conversion shal] be endorsed or accompanied by wnitten instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered
holder or by his or its attorney duly authorized in writing. As soon as practicable after the
Mandatory Conversion Date and the surrender of the certificate or certificates for Preferred
Stock, the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to such holder, or on his or its
written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable
on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as provided in
Subsection 4(b) in respect of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon
such conversion.

(c) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are required to
be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after the
Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the shares of
Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes,
notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or
prior to such date. Such converted Preferred Stock may not be reissued, and the Corporation
may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be
necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.

Corporation at any time on or after January 24, 2012 from the holders of at least sixty-six and
two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the then outstanding shares of Senior Preferred Stock, voting
together as a single class, of written notice requesting redemption of all shares of Senior
Preferred Stock (the date of each such installment being referred to as a “Redemption Date’’).
The Corporation shall redeem one-third of each redeeming holder’s shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, one-third of each redeeming holder’s shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, one-third of
each redeeming holder’s shares of Series B Preferred Stock, one-third of each redeeming
holder’s shares of Series C Preferred Stock and one-third of each redeeming holder’s shares of
Series D Preferred Stock on the first Redemption Date, 50% of each redeeming holder's shares
of Series A Preferred Stock, 50% of each redeeming holder’s shares of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock, 50% of each redeeming holder’s shares of Series B Preferred Stock, 50% of each
redeeming holder’s shares of Series C Preferred Stock and 50% of each redeeming holder’s
shares of Series D Preferred Stock on the second Redemption Date, and the remainder of each
redeeming holder’s shares of Senior Preferred Stock on the third Redemption Date. If the
Corporation does not have sufficient funds legally available to redeem all of the shares of Senior
Preferred Stock required to be redeemed on any Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem
a pro rata portion of each holder’s shares of Senior Preferred Stock out of funds legally available
therefor, and holders of Senior Preferred Stock shall share ratably in such redemption, in each
case, in proportion to the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of
shares to be redeemed from such holders; the Corporation shall redeem the remaining shares to
have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally available
therefor.

(b) Redemption Notice. Written notice of the mandatory redemption (the
“Redemption Notice”) shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of Senior
Preferred Stock, at its post office address last shown on the records of the Corporation, or given
by electronic communication in compliance with the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, not less than 30 days prior to each Redemption Date. Each Redemption
Notice shall state:

by the holder that the Corporation shall redeem on
the Redemption Date specified in the Redemption

(II) the Redemption Date and the Series A Redemption
Price, Series A-1 Redemption Price, Series B

(III) the date upon which the holder’s right to convert
such shares terminates (as determined in accordance
with Section 4(a)); and

(IV) _ that the holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in
the manner and at the place designated, his
certificate or certificates representing the shares of
Senior Preferred Stock to be redeemed.

(c) Surrender of Certificates; Payment. On or before the applicable
Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Senior Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such
Redemption Date, unless such holder has exercised his right to convert such shares as provided
in Section 4 hereof, shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the
Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon
the Series A Redemption Price, Series A-1 Redemption Price, Series B Redemption Price, Series
C Redemption Price or Series D Redemption Price, as the case may be, for such shares shall be
payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the
owner thereof, and each surrendered certificate shall be canceled and retired. In the event less
than all of the shares of Senior Preferred Stock represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new
certificate representing the unredeemed shares of Senior Preferred Stock shall promptly be
issued.

(d) Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall have
been duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the applicable Redemption Price
payable upon redemption of the shares of Senior Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such
Redemption Date is paid or tendered for payment, then notwithstanding that the certificates
evidencing any of the shares of Senior Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not have
been surrendered, dividends with respect to such shares of Senior Preferred Stock shall cease to
accrue after such Redemption Date and all rights with respect to such shares shal] forthwith after
the Redemption Date terminate, except only the right of the holders to receive the applicable
Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor.

(c) Any shares of Senior Preferred Stock redeemed pursuant to this Section 6
will be cancelled and will not under any circumstances be reissued, sold or transferred and the
Corporation may from time to time take such appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce
the authorized Preferred Stock accordingly.

herein may be waived by the affirmative consent or vote of the holders of at least 60% of the

8. Corporate Opportunities. The Corporation renounces any interest or expectancy
of the Corporation in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any Excluded
Opportunity. An “Excluded Opportunity” is any matter, transaction or interest that is presented
to, or acquired, created or developed by, or which otherwise comes into the possession of, (i) any
director of the Corporation who is not an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries,
or (ii) any holder of Senior Preferred Stock or any partner, member, director, stockholder,
employee or agent of any such holder, other than someone who is an employee of the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, “Covered Persons’), unless such matter,
transaction or interest is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or otherwise comes
into the possession of, a Covered Person expressly and solely in such Covered Person’s capacity
as a director of the Corporation.

FIFTH. In furtherance of and not in limitation of powers conferred by statute, it is
further provided:

1. Election of directors need not be by written ballot.

2. The Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal
the By-Laws of the Corporation.

SIXTH. Except to the extent that the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware prohibits the elimination or limitation of liability of directors for breaches of fiduciary
duty, no director of the Corporation shal! be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
notwithstanding any provision of law imposing such liability. No amendment to or repeal of this
provision shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of
the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to
such amendment.

SEVENTH. 1. Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of the
Corporation. The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a party or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the
Corporation), by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or
officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the
Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all
such persons being referred to hereafter as an “Indemnitee”), or by reason of any action alleged

- 24 -

USI DOCS 6294257v3

to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on
his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and
in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to
believe that his conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article,
except as set forth in Section 7 below, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee
seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the
Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article, the Corporation shall not
indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of
insurance, and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments to an
Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance,
such Indemnitee shall promptly refund such indemnification payments to the Corporation to the
extent of such insurance reimbursement.

2. Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation. The Corporation shall

indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the night of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become, a director
or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the
Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or by
reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) and, to the extent permitted by law, amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding and any appeal! therefrom, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, except that no
indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person
shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the
Court of Chancery of Delaware shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including attorneys’ fees) which the Court of
Chancery of Delaware shall deem proper.

3. Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party. Notwithstanding the other
provisions of this Article, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or
otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this
Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action,
suit or proceeding, he shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith. Without

-25-

USIDOCS 6294257v3

limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise
(including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to the
Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of
guilty or nolo contendere by the Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the Indemnitee did not act
in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that the
Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, the Indemnitee shall be
considered for the purposes hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto.

4, Notification and Defense of Claim. As a condition precedent to his right to be
indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving him for which indemnity will or could be
sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is
so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to
assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to the Indemnitee of its election so to assume
such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by the [ndemnitee in connection with such claim, other than as
provided below in this Section 4. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel
in connection with such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice
from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the
Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the
Corporation, (ii) counsel to the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a
conflict of interest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and the
Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact
have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and
expenses of counsel for the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as
otherwise expressly provided by this Article. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the
consent of the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the
Corporation or as to which counsel for the Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the conclusion
provided for in clause (ii) above.

5. Advance of Expenses. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 below, in the event
that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section 4 of this Article of any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under this
Article, any expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending a civil
or criminal action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the
Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter; provided. however, that the
payment of such expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such
matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to
repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that the
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article.
Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of the Indemnitee to
make such repayment.

USIDOCS 6294257v3

6. Procedure for Indemnification. In order to obtain indemnification or
advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article, the Indemnitee shall
submit to the Corporation a written request, including in such request such documentation and
information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to
determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or
advancement of expenses. Any such indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made
promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request
of the Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests under Section |, 2 or 5 the Corporation
determines within such 60-day period that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in Section | or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each
instance by (a) a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are
not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question (“‘disinterested directors”),
whether or not a quorum, (b) a majority vote of a quorum of the outstanding shares of stock of all
classes entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class, which quorum shall consist of
stockholders who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question. (c)
independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to
the Corporation), or (d) a court of competent jurisdiction.

7. Remedies. The right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article
shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation
denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the 60-day
period referred to above in Section 6. Unless otherwise required by law, the burden of proving
that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this
Article shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the
circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation pursuant to Section 6 that the Indemnitee has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The Indemnitee’s expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to
indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the
Corporation.

8. Subsequent Amendment. No amendment, termination or repeal! of this Article or
of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any other
applicable laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to
indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the
final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal.

9. Other Rights. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this
Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee seeking
indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or
statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in his official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office for the
Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer,

-27-
US1DOCS 6294257v3

and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of the Indemnitee.
Nothing contained in this Article shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically
authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing indemnification rights
and procedures different from those set forth in this Article. In addition, the Corporation may, to
the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification nghts to
other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons serving the Corporation and such
rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article.

10. Partial Indemnification. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this
Article to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the expenses (including
attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred
by him or on his behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any
appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall
nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys”
fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to which the Indemnitee is entitled.

11. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense,
to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit
plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of
his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such
person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware.

12. Merger or Consolidation. If the Corporation is merged into or consolidated with
another corporation and the Corporation is not the surviving corporation, the surviving
corporation shall assume the obligations of the Corporation under this Article with respect to any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or
facts occurring prior to the date of such merger or consolidation.

13. Savings Clause. If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any
ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify
each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the nght of the Corporation, to the fullest
extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

14. Definitions. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and Section 145(i)
of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware shall have the respective meanings
assigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section 145(i).

15. Subsequent Legislation. If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
is amended after adoption of this Article to expand further the indemnification permitted to
Indemnitees, then the Corporation shall indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as so amended.
