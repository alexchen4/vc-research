(f) | The Company shall not make any distribution of securities of other
persons, cash or other property without consideration, whether by way of dividend or otherwise,
to the holders of Common Stock except in accordance with this Section 1.

2. Liquidation Preference.

(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Company, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock, Series D
Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the Company to the
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other junior equity security of the
Company by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to $4.417 for each
outstanding share of Series E Preferred Stock (the “Original Series E Issue Price”), an amount
per share equal to $4.417 for each outstanding share of Series D Preferred Stock (the “Original
Series D Issue Price”), an amount per share equal to $4.16 for each outstanding share of Series C
Preferred Stock (the “Original Series C Issue Price”) and an amount per share equal to $1.75 for
each outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock (the “Original Series B Issue Price”) plus all
declared but unpaid dividends on such share (as adjusted for any dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like after the filing date hereof). If upon the occurrence of such event,
the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock, Series D
Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to
permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire
assets and funds of the Company legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably

GDSVF&H\824755.7 4

among the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
Stock and Series B Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount of Series E
Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock
that each such holder is otherwise entitled to receive under this subsection (a).

(6) | Upon the completion of the distribution required by Section 2(a),
the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any
distribution of any of the assets of the Company to the holders of Common Stock or other junior
equity security of the Company by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal
to $0.41 for each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Original Series A Issue
Price”), plus all declared but unpaid dividends on such share (as adjusted for any dividends,
combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like after the filing date hereof). If upon the
occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid
preferential amounts, then the entire assets and funds of the Company legally available for
distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in
proportion to the amount of such stock owned by each such holder.

(c) | Upon the completion of the distribution required by Sections 2(a)
and 2(b), the entire remaining assets and funds of the Company legally available for distribution,
if any, shall be distributed among the holders of the Common Stock pro rata based on the number
of shares of Common Stock held by each.

(d) (i) For purposes of this Section B.2, a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (A) the
acquisition of the Company by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related
transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation but,
excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the
Company); (B) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; unless the
Company’s stockholders of record as constituted immediately prior to such Acquisition (as
defined below) will, immediately after such Acquisition (by virtue of securities issued as
consideration for the Acquisition or otherwise) hold at least 50% of the voting power of the
surviving or acquiring entity; or (C) an exclusive licensing of all or substantially all of the
Company’s intellectual property to a third party (any such acquisition, sale or licensing described
in clause (A), (B) or (C), an “Acquisition”). In such event, the holders of Preferred Stock and
Common Stock shall be entitled to receive at the closing of such Acquisition in cash, securities
or other property amounts as specified in subsections 2(a), (b) and (c). Notwithstanding the
above, for purposes of determining the amount each holder of shares of Preferred Stock is
entitled to receive with respect to an Acquisition, unless a holder of shares of a series of
Preferred Stock otherwise instructs this corporation in writing prior to the Acquisition, each such
holder shall be deemed to have converted (regardless of whether such holder actually converted)
such holder’s shares of such series into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the
Liquidation Event if, as a result of an actual conversion, such holder would receive, in the
aggregate, an amount greater than the amount that would be distributed to such holder if such
holder did not convert such series of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. If any such
holder shall be deemed to have converted shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant
to this paragraph, then such holder shall not be entitled to receive any distribution that would

GDSVF&H\824755.7 5

otherwise be made to holders of Preferred Stock that have not converted (or have not been
deemed to have converted) into shares of Common Stock.

(ii) ——‘ In any of such events, if the consideration received by the
Company is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Any securities shall
be valued as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability:

(1) If traded on a USS. securities exchange, the
value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange
over the 20-day period ending two (2) days prior to the closing of such liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices over the 20-day period ending two
days prior to the closing of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company; and

(3) ‘If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually determined by the Company and the holders of
at least fifty-five percent (55%) of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock,

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount, if any, from the market value determined as set forth above in Section
2(d)(ii)(A) (1), (2) or (3) to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof, as mutually
determined by the Company and the holders of at least fifty-five percent (55%) of the voting
power of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

(iii) In the event the requirements of this subsection 2(d) are not
complied with, the Company shall forthwith either:

(A) cause such closing to be postponed until such time
as the requirements of this Section 2 have been complied with; or

(B) cancel such transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as
such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice
referred to in subsection 2(d)(iv) hereof.

(iv) The Company shall give each holder of record of Preferred
Stock written notice of such impending transaction not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the
stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or fifteen (15) days prior to the closing
of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final
approval of such transaction. The first of such notices shall describe the material terms and

GDS VF&H\824755.7 6

conditions of the impending transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and the Company
shall thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The transaction shall in
no event take place sooner than fifteen (15) days after the Company has given the first notice
provided for herein or sooner than five (5) days after the Company has given notice of any
material changes provided for herein. In connection with any proposed Acquisition transaction,
holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to conditionally convert their shares of Preferred
Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as provided in Section B.4 of this Article IV
contingent upon the consummation of the Acquisition; it being the intent of this Section that
holders of Preferred Stock be given the opportunity to maximize the return on their investment in
the event that they convert their shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock and not to require
the holders of Preferred Stock to convert if, for any reason, the Acquisition provided for in the
notice to the holders of Preferred Stock is not consummated.

(v) | Shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be
converted into shares of Common Stock in order to participate in any distribution, or series of
distributions, as shares of Common Stock, without first foregoing participation in the
distribution, or series of distributions, as shares of Preferred Stock.

3, Redemption.

(a) Redemption. Within 30 days after receipt by the Company, at any
time on or within one hundred eighty (180) days after the seventh (7th) anniversary of the
Purchase Date, from the holders of at least a majority of all then outstanding shares of Series E
Preferred Stock of written notice requesting redemption of the Series E Preferred Stock (the
“Redemption Date”), all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the
Company out of funds lawfully available therefor at a price equal to the Series E Original Issue
Price per share for such shares, plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon (the “Redemption
Price”). On the Redemption Date, the Company shall redeem all shares of Series E Preferred
Stock that have been requested to be redeemed outstanding immediately prior to such
Redemption Date. If the Company does not have sufficient funds legally permissible for
redemption on the Redemption Date of all shares of Series E Preferred Stock, the Company shall
redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s redeemable shares of such capital stock out of funds
legally permissible for redemption, based on the respective amounts which would otherwise be
payable in respect of the shares to be redeemed if the legally permissible funds were sufficient to
redeem all such shares, and shall redeem the remaining shares to have been redeemed as soon as
practicable after the Company has funds legally permissible for redemption.

(b) Redemption Notice. Written notice of the mandatory redemption
(the “Redemption Notice”) shall be sent to each holder of record of Series E Preferred Stock to
be redeemed not less than 15 days prior to the Redemption Date. The Redemption Notice shall
state:

(i) the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by
the holder that the Company shall redeem on the Redemption Date specified i in the Redemption
Notice;

(ii) | the Redemption Date and the Redemption Price; and

GDSVF&HN\3824755.7 7

(iii) that the holder is to surrender to the Company, in the
manner and at the place designated, his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the
shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed.

(c) Surrender of Certificates; Payment. On or before the Redemption
Date, each holder of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, unless such holder has exercised his, her
or its right to convert such shares as provided in Section 4, shall surrender the certificate or
certificates representing such shares (or, if such registered holder alleges that such certificate has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to
the Company to indemnify the Company against any claim that may be made against the
Company on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Company,
in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the
Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears
on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof.

(d) Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall
have been duly given, and if on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon
redemption of the shares of Preferred Stock is paid or tendered for payment or deposited with an
independent payment agent so as to be available therefor, then notwithstanding that the
certificates evidencing any of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock so called for redemption
shall not have been surrendered, all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith after the
Redemption Date terminate, except only the right of the holders to receive the Redemption Price
without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor. Any Redemption Price
that is not paid when due shall bear interest on the unpaid balance at an annual interest rate of
interest equal to the lesser of 10% and the highest rate permitted by law.

4, Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion
rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be
convertible at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such
share, and on or prior to the fifth day prior to the Redemption Date, if any, as may have been
fixed in any Redemption Notice with respect to such share of the Series E Preferred Stock, at the
office of the Company or any transfer agent for Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock, as the case
may be, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is
determined by dividing the Original Series A Issue Price, Original Series B Issue Price, Original
Series C Issue Price, Original Series D Issue Price or Original Series E Issue Price, as the case
may be (in each case as defined in Section B.2 above) by the Conversion Price applicable to the
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred
Stock or Series E Preferred Stock, as the case may be, in effect on the date the certificate is
surrendered for conversion. The initial “Conversion Price” per share for shares of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series A Issue Price, the initial “Conversion Price” per
share for shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series B Issue Price, the initial
“Conversion Price” per share for shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series
C Issue Price, the initial “Conversion Price” per share for shares of Series D Preferred Stock
shall be the Original Series D Issue Price and the initial “Conversion Price” per share for shares

GDS VF&H\824755.7 8

of Series E Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series E Issue Price; provided, however, that the
Conversion Prices for the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock shall be subject to
adjustment as set forth in Section 4(d).

(b) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Series E Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common
Stock, at the Conversion Price at the time in effect for each such series of Preferred Stock,
immediately upon the earlier of (i) except as provided below in subsection 4(c), the closing of
the sale by the Company of Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act’), other than a
registration relating solely to a transaction under Rule 145 under the Securities Act (or any
successor thereto) or to an employee benefit plan of the Company, that results in gross offering
proceeds (before deduction of underwriters’ discounts and commissions and expenses) to the
Company and/or any selling stockholders of more than $30,000,000 in the aggregate and a per
share public offering price of at least $9.00 (subject to adjustment to reflect subsequent stock
dividends, stock splits, stock combinations or other recapitalizations) (a “Qualified Public
Offering”) or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of at least a
majority of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and
Series E Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series and on an as-
converted basis).

(ii) | Each share of Series B Preferred Stock and Series A
Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the
Conversion Price at the time in effect for each such series of Preferred Stock, immediately upon
the earlier of (i) except as provided below in subsection 4(c), the closing of the sale by the
Company of Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering registered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), other than a registration relating
solely to a transaction under Rule 145 under the Securities Act (or any successor thereto) or to an
employee benefit plan of the Company, that results in gross offering proceeds (before deduction
of underwriters’ discounts and commissions and expenses) to the Company and/or any selling
stockholders of more than $30,000,000 in the aggregate and a per share public offering price of
at least $9.00 (subject to adjustment to reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits, stock
combinations or other recapitalizations) or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement
of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock
and Series A Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series and on
an as-converted basis).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion.

(i) Before any holder of a series of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer
agent for such series of Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at its
principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or

GDSVF&EN824755,7 9

names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued;
provided, however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to subsection 4(b), the
outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any
further action by the holder of such shares and whether or not the certificate representing such
shares is surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, further, however, that the
Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable’upon such automatic conversion unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of
Preferred Stock are delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided above, or the
holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable after the surrender by a holder of the certificate representing shares of the Preferred
Stock in accordance with this subsection 4(c), issue and deliver at such office to such holder of
such series of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or
certificates, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of such series of Preferred Stock to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock as of such date.

(ii) | If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten
offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act, the conversion may, at the option
of any holder tendering shares of such series of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned
upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in
which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
of such series of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such shares of such
series of Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.

(iii) If the conversion occurs through the vote of the holders of
at least a majority of the shares of one or more classes of Preferred Stock then outstanding
(voting together as a single class and not as a separate series and on an as-converted basis)
pursuant to subsection (b), such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of
business on the day written notice of such election has been received by the Company, and the
person or persons entitled to receive shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock
on such date. Until certificates for such shares of Preferred-Stock of the applicable classes that
have been converted have been delivered to the Company for exchange for certificates
representing shares of Common Stock, such certificates shall be deemed to represent the shares
of Common Stock into which such shares of the applicable classes of Preferred Stock have been
converted,

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations, The Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred

GDSVE&H\824755.7 10

Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock
and the Series E Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) (A) If the Company shall issue, after the date upon
which any share of Series E Preferred Stock was first issued (the “Purchase Date”), any
Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and/or Series E Preferred Stock in effect immediately
prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and/or
Series E Preferred Stock, as appropriate, in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall
forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined by
multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of
shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for such
issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and the denominator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the
number of shares of such Additional Stock. For the purpose of the foregoing calculation, the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance shall be
calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if all shares of Preferred Stock and all other securities
convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (‘Convertible Securities”) had been fully
converted into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such issuance and any currently
exercisable warrants, options or other rights for the purchase of shares of stock or convertible
securities had been fully exercised immediately prior to such issuance (and the resulting
securities fully converted into shares of Common Stock, if so convertible), but not including in
such calculation any additional shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to shares of
Preferred Stock, Convertible Securities, or currently exercisable options, warrants or other rights
for the purchase of shares of stock or Convertible Securities, solely as a result of the adjustment
of such Conversion Price (or other conversion ratios) resulting from the issuance of Additional
Stock causing such adjustment.

(B) No adjustment of the Conversion Price for Preferred
Stock shall be made in an amount less than one cent per share, provided that any adjustments
which are not required to be made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall
be either taken into account in any subsequent adjustment made prior to three years from the date
of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of
three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment being carried forward. Except
to the limited extent provided for in subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(3) and 4(d)@)(E)(4) below, no
adjustment of such Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this
subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price for such series of
Preferred Stock above the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect
immediately prior to such adjustment.

(C) In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for
cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor before deducting
any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the
Company for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

GDS VF&H\824755.7 11

(D) In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for
a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board: of Directors irrespective of any
accounting treatment.

, (E) In the case of the issuance (whether before, on or
after the applicable Purchase Date) of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock, Convertible Securities, or options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Convertible
Securities, the following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this subsection 4(d)(i) and
subsection 4(d)(ii):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability, including without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of such options to purchase or rights to subscribe for Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such options or rights were issued and for
a consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in subsections
4(d)(i)(C) and 4(d)(i)(D)), if any, received by the Company upon the issuance of such options or
rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in such options or rights (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Stock covered thereby.

(2) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of
any conditions to. convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage of
time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) for any such Convertible
Securities or upon the exercise of options to purchase or rights to subscribe for such Convertible
Securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at
the time such securities were issued or such options or rights were issued and for a consideration
equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Company for any such securities and related
options or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued
dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Company
(without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange
of such securities or the exercise of any related options or rights (the consideration in each case
to be determined in the manner provided in subsections 4(d)(i)(C) and 4(d)(i)(D)).

(3) In the event of any change in the number of

shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Company upon
exercise of such options or rights or upon conversion of or in exchange for such Convertible
Securities, including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions
thereof, the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock, to the extent in any way affected
by or computed using such options, rights or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such
change, but no further adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any
payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options or rights or the conversion
or exchange of such securities; provided, however, that this subsection shall not have any effect

on any conversion of such series of Preferred Stock that occurred prior to such change or
increase.

GDS VF&H\824755.7 12

(4) | Upon the expiration of any such options or
rights, the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange or the expiration of any options
or rights related to such Convertible Securities, the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred
Stock, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, rights or securities
or options or rights related to such securities, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only
the number of shares of Common Stock (and convertible or exchangeable securities that remain
in effect) actually issued upon the exercise of such options or rights, upon the conversion or
exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of the options or rights related to such
securities; provided, however, that this subsection shall not have any effect on any conversion of
such series of Preferred Stock that occurred prior to such change or increase.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(1)
and 4(d)(i)(E)(2) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration
of the type described in either subsection 4(d)(i)(E)(3) or 4(d)(i)(E)(4).

Stock shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant

entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock
or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or

Equivalents”) without a corresponding subdivision, dividend or other distribution to holders of
Preferred Stock and without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional
shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the
date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion
Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of

_shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased

decrease in outstanding shares.

(v) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the

subsection 4(d){i) may be waived with respect to any specific share or shares of Preferred Stock,
either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a particular instance by a writing
executed by the registered holder of such share or shares. Any waiver pursuant to this
subsection 4(d)(v) shall bind all future holders of the shares of Preferred Stock for which rights
have been waived. In the event that a waiver of adjustment of Conversion Price under this
subsection 4(d)(v) results in different Conversion Prices for shares of a series of Preferred Stock,

for each share of such series of Preferred Stock. Such information shall be made available to any
person upon request,

be entitled to receive, upon conversion thereof, the number of shares of stock or other securities
or property of the Company or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon
conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this subsection 4 with respect to
the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after the recapitalization or reorganization to the
end that the provisions of this subsection 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in
effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be
applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

(ii) | If any consolidation or merger of the Company with
another company or entity shall be effected, then, as a condition of such consolidation or merger,
lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby the holders of the Preferred Stock shall
thereafter have the right to receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified

number of outstanding shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consolidation or
merger. In any such case, appropriate provision shall be made with respect to the rights and
interests of the holders of the Preferred Stock to the end that the provisions hereof (including,
without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the each applicable Conversion Price) shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be practicable, in relation to any shares of stock,
securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of such conversion rights. Except as
expressly set forth in this subsection (ii), nothing in this subsection 4(f(ii) will be deemed to
restrict the Company from entering into a consolidation or merger.

transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other
voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be
observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the
carrying out of all the provisions of this subsection 4 and in the taking of all such action as may
be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the
Preferred Stock against impairment.

any share or shares of the Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be -
issued shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and the Company shall pay in cash the
fair market value of any fractional shares as of the time when entitlement to receive such
fractions is determined. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall
be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the
time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such aggregate conversion.

(ii) | Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of
the Conversion Price of Preferred Stock pursuant to this subsection 4, the Company, at its
expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms
hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or

shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect such conversion, in addition to such
other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Company will take
such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient
for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite
stockholder ‘approval of any necessary amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation.
