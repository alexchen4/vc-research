dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities and rights convertible into or
entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock

2. Liquidation.

(a) Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Series A, Series B,
Series C, Series D and Series E Preferred Stock shal! be entitled to receive, prior and in
preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the Corporation to the holders of Common
Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to (i) $1.25 per share (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like) for each share of Series A
Preferred Stock held by them at the closing of such transaction, plus all declared but unpaid
dividends payable on the Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) $1.847 per share (as adjusted for stock
splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like) for each share of Series B Preferred Stock
held by them at the closing of such transaction, plus all declared but unpaid dividends payable on
the Series B Preferred Stock, (iii) $2.38 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends,

reclassification and the like) for each share of Series E Preferred Stock held by them at the
closing of such transaction, plus all declared but unpaid dividends payable on the Series E
Preferred Stock. If, upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed
among the holders of the Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E Preferred Stock
shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential
amounts, then the entire assets and funds of the Corporation legally available for distribution
shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D and
Series E Preferred Stock in proportion to the preferential amount each such holder is otherwise
entitled to receive.

(b) Remaining Assets.

(i) Upon the completion of the distribution required by Section
2(a) above, the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to stockholders
shall be distributed among the holders of the Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E
Preferred Stock and the Common Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Common
Stock held by each at the closing of such transaction (assuming conversion of all such Series
Preferred into Common Stock) until:

(A) with respect to the holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock, such holders shall have received the greater of (x) an aggregate of $3.125 per share (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like) of Series A Preferred
Stock held by them at the closing of such transaction or (y) the amount such holder would have
received if such holder had converted his, her or its shares of Series A Preferred Stock into
Common Stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation;

24275639_2.DOC 3

(B) — with respect to the holders of the Series B Preferred
Stock, such holders shall have received the greater of (x) an aggregate of $4.6175 per share (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like) of Series B Preferred
Stock held by them at the closing of such transaction or (y) the amount such holder would have
received if such holder had converted his, her or its shares of Series B Preferred Stock into
Common Stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation;

(C) with respect to the holders of the Series C Preferred
Stock, such holders shall have received the greater of (x) an aggregate of $5.95 per share (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like) of Series C Preferred
Stock held by them at the closing of such transaction or (y) the amount such holder would have
received if such holder had converted his, her or its shares of Series C Preferred Stock into
Common Stock immediately prior to such dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the
Corporation;

(D) with respect to the holders of the Series D Preferred
Stock, such holders shall have received the greater of (x) an aggregate of $7.094 per share (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like) of Series D Preferred
Stock held by them at the closing of such transaction or (y) the amount such holder would have
received if such holder had converted his, her or its shares of Series D Preferred Stock into
Common Stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation; and

(E) — with respect to the holders of the Series E Preferred
Stock, such holders shall have received the greater of (x) an aggregate of $8.925 per share (as
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassification and the like) of Series E Preferred
Stock held by them at the closing of such transaction or (y) the amount such holder would have

Common Stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation.

(iii) In determining the amount any holder of Series Preferred shal)
receive pursuant to this Section 2(b), (X) the amount of all distributions previously received by
such holder pursuant to Section 2(a) and (b) shall be taken into account and included in such
amount, (Y) the amount of all prior distribution shall be valued at the time of their initial
distribution (i.e. no appreciation or depreciation of the value of any prior distribution shall be
taken into account), and (Z) the application of Section 2(b) to all series of Preferred Stock shall
be taken into account.

(c) Certain Acquisitions.

(i) Deemed Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 2, a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall be deemed to occur if the
Corporation shall sell, convey, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all ofits property or
business or merge with or into or consolidate with any other corporation, limited liability
company or other entity (other than a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation) or effect any

24275639_2.DOC 4

other transaction or series of related transactions in which the stockholders of the Corporation
immediately prior to such transactions(s) own less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power
of the surviving entity immediately after such transaction(s) (any such transaction or
transactions, a “Liquidation Transaction”); provided that none of the following shall be
considered a Liquidation Transaction: (i) a merger effected exclusively for the purpose of
changing the domicile of the Corporation or (ii) an equity financing in which the Corporation is
the surviving corporation.

(ii) Valuation of Consideration. In the event of a deemed
liquidation as described in Section 2(c)(i) above, if the consideration received by the Corporation
is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Any securities shall be valued
as follows:

(A) Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free marketability:

(1)  [ftraded on a securities exchange or The
Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”), the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing
prices of the securities on such exchange over the thirty-day period ending three (3) days prior to
the closing;

(2) If actively traded over-the-counter, the value
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid or sales prices (whichever is applicable) of
the securities over the thirty-day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing; and

(3) If there is no active public market, the value
shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(B) The method of valuation of securities subject to
investment letter or other restrictions on free marketability (other than restrictions arising solely
by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall be to make an
appropriate discount from the market value determined as above in Section 2(c)(ii)(A) to reflect
the approximate fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(iii) Notice of Liquidation Transaction. The Corporation
shall give each holder of record of Series Preferred written notice of any impending Liquidation

Transaction not later than ten (10) days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such
Liquidation Transaction, or ten (10) days prior to the closing of such Liquidation Transaction,
whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final approval of such
Liquidation Transaction. The first of such notices shal! describe the material terms and
conditions of the impending Liquidation Transaction and the provisions of this Section 2, and the
Corporation shail thereafter give such holders prompt notice of any material changes. The
Liquidation Transaction shall in no event take place sooner than ten (10) days after the
Corporation bas given the first notice provided for herein or sooner than ten (10) days after the
Corporation has given notice of any material changes provided for herein; provided, however,
that such periods may be shortened upon the written consent of the holders of Series Preferred

24275639_2.DOC 5

that are entitled to such notice rights or similar notice rights and that represent at least a majority
of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of such Series Preferred.

(iv) Effect of Noncompliance. In the event the requirements
of this Section 2(c) are not complied with, the Corporation shal! forthwith either cause the
closing of the Liquidation Transaction to be postponed until the requirements of this Section 2
have been complied with, or cancel such Liquidation Transaction, in which event the rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions of the holders of Series Preferred shall revert to and be
the same as such rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions existing immediately prior to the
date of the first notice referred to in Section 2(c)(iii) hereof.

3, Redemption. The Series Preferred is not redeemable.

4, Conversion. The holders of Series Preferred shall have conversion rights
as follows (the “Conversion Rights”):

(a) Right to Convert. Subject to Section 4(c), each share of Series A,
Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of
the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the
Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing (i) $1.25 in the case of the
Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) $1.847 in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock, (iii) $2.38 in the
case of the Series C Preferred Stock, (iv) $3.547 in the case of the Series D Preferred Stock and
(v) $5.10 in the case of the Series E Preferred Stock, by the Conversion Price applicable to such
share, determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for
conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share shall be $1.25 for shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, $1.847 for shares of Series B Preferred Stock, $2.38 for the shares of Series C
Preferred Stock, $3.547 for shares of Series D Preferred Stock and $5.10 for shares of Series E
Preferred Stock. Such initial Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in
Section 4(d) below.

(b) Automatic Conversion. Each share of Series A, Series B,
Series C, Series D and Series E Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of
Common Stock at the Conversion Price at the time in effect for such share immediately upon the
earlier of (i) except as provided below in Section 4(c), upon the closing of a firm commitment
underwritten public offering of the Corporation’s Common Stock at a price per share of not less
than $8.925 (as adjusted for stock splits, dividends and the like) and for a total offering of not
less than $30,000,000 (before deductions of underwriters commissions and expenses) (a
“Qualified IPO”) pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act”) or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the
holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series Preferred, voting together as a
single class.

({c) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series Preferred
shall be entitled to convert such Series Preferred into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or
of any transfer agent for such series of Series Preferred or the holder shall notify the Corporation

24275639_2.DOC 6

or its transfer agent that such certificate(s) have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an
agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred
by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at its
principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or
names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued;
provided, however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to paragraph 4(b)
above, the outstanding shares of such Series Preferred shall be converted automatically without
any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing
such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided further, however,
that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless either the certificates evidencing such
shares of Series Preferred are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided
above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been
lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify
the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. The
Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such
holder of Series Preferred, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as
aforesaid. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of such series of Series Preferred to be
converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shal] be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock as of such date. If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten
offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act the conversion may, at the option
of any holder tendering such Series Preferred for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing
with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the
person(s) entitled to receive Common Stock upon conversion of such Series Preferred shall not
be deemed to have converted such Series Preferred until immediately prior to the closing of such
sale of securities. All shares of Series Preferred which shall have been surrendered for
conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with
respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall
immediately cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of
Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any dividends declared but
unpaid thereon. Any shares of Series Preferred so converted shall be retired and cancelled and
shall not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation (without the need for
stockholder action) may from time to time take such appropriate action as may be necessary to
reduce the authorized number of shares of such Series Preferred accordingly.

(d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Series Preferred for Certain
Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations. The Conversion Price of the Series Preferred

shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

(i) Issuance of Additional Stock below Purchase Price. If
the Corporation should issue, at any time after the date upon which any shares of Series E
Preferred Stock were just issued (the "Purchase Date"), any Additional Stock (as defined below)
without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for such

24275639_2. DOC 7

series in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Conversion Price
for such series in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall automatically be adjusted
as set forth in this Section 4(d)(i), unless otherwise provided in this Section 4(d)(i).

(A) Adjustment Formula. Whenever the Conversion
Price is adjusted pursuant to this Section (4)(d)(i), the new Conversion Price shall be determined
by multiplying the Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance (the
“Outstanding Common”) plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of shares of Additional Stock so
issued would purchase at such Conversion Price; and (y) the denominator of which shall be the
number of shares of Outstanding Common plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock so
issued. For purposes of the foregoing calculation, the term “Outstanding Common” shall include
shares of Common Stock deemed issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E) below.

(B) Definition of “Additional Stock”. For purposes of
this Section 4(d)(i), “Additional Stock” shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or
deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E)) by the Corporation after the Purchase
Date) other than

(1) Common Stock issued pursuant to stock
dividends, stock splits or similar transactions, as described in Section 4(d)(ii) hereof;

(2) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
to employees, consultants or directors of the Corporation directly or pursuant to a stock option
plan, restricted stock plan or other stock plan or other agreements, the terms of which are
approved by the Board of Directors, including a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors elected by the holders of Series Preferred (the “Preferred Directors”);

(3) Capital stock, or options or warrants to
purchase capital stock, issued to financial institutions or lessors in connection with commercial
credit arrangements, equipment financings, commercial property lease transactions or similar
transactions, the terms of which are approved by the Board of Directors, including a majority of
the Preferred Directors;

(4) Capital stock issued upon the conversion or
exercise of convertible or exercisable securities, including options and warrants granted prior to
the date of this Restated Certificate;

(5) Capital stock, or warrants or options to
purchase capital stock, issued in connection with bona fide acquisitions, mergers or similar
transactions, the terms of which are approved by the Board of Directors, including a majority of
the Preferred Directors;

(6) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
upon conversion of the Series Preferred;

24275639_2.DOC 8

(7) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
in a public offering prior to or in connection with which all outstanding shares of Series
Preferred will be converted to Common Stock;

(8) Capital stock issued or issuable to an entity
as a component of any business relationship with such entity for the purpose of (A) joint venture,
technology licensing or development activities, (B) distribution, supply or manufacture of the
Corporation’s products or services or (C) any other arrangements involving corporate partners
that are primarily for purposes other than raising capital, the terms of which business relationship
with such entity are approved by the Board of Directors, including a majority of the Preferred
Directors; and

(9) Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
with the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series Preferred,
voting together as a class.

(C) No Fractional Adjustments. No adjustment of the
Conversion Price for the Series Preferred shall be made in an amount less than one cent per
share, provided that any adjustments which are not required to be made by reason of this
sentence shall be carried forward and shall be either taken into account in any subsequent
adjustment made prior to three years from the date of the event giving rise to the adjustment
being carried forward, or shall be made at the end of three years from the date of the event giving
rise to the adjustment being carried forward.

(D) Determination of Consideration. In the case of
the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of
cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other expenses
allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection
with the issuance and sale thereof. In the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for a
consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be
deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any
accounting treatment.

(E) Deemed Issuances of Common Stock. In the case
of the issuance (whether before, on or after the applicable Purchase Date) of securities or rights
convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional shares
of Common Stock (the “Common Stock Equivalents”), the following provisions shall apply for
all purposes of this Section 4(d)(i):

(1) The aggregate maximum number of shares
of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion, exchange or exercise (assuming the satisfaction
of any conditions to convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability, including, without
limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) of any Common Stock Equivalents and subsequent conversion, exchange or
exercise thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or
such Common Stock Equivalents were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration,
if any, received by the Corporation for any such securities and related Common Stock

24275639_2.DOC 9

Equivalents (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends),
plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Corporation (without
taking into account potential] antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise
of any Common Stock Equivalents (the consideration in each case to be determined in the
manner provided in Section 4(d)G)(D).

(2) In the event of any change in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon
conversion, exchange or exercise of any Common Stock Equivalents, other than a change
resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the Conversion Price of any series of Series
Preferred, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such Common Stock
Equivalents, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made
for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment of such consideration upon the
conversion, exchange or exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents.

(3) — Upon the termination or expiration of the
convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability of any Common Stock Equivalents, the
Conversion Price of any series of Series Preferred, to the extent in any way affected by or
computed using such Common Stock Equivalents, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of
only the number of shares of Common Stock (and Common Stock Equivalents that remain
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable) actually issued upon the conversion, exchange or
exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents.

(4) The number of shares of Common Stock
deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Section 4(d)(i)(E)(1) shall
be appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the type described in
either Section 4(d)()(E)(2) or 4(d)() (EJB).

(F) No Increased Conversion Price. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Section (4)(d)(i), except to the limited extent provided for in
Sections 4(d)(i)(E)(2) and 4(d)(i)(E)(3), no adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this
Section 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.

(ii) Stock Splits and Dividends, In the event the Corporation
should at any time after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of
Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents without payment of any consideration by such
holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including
the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of
such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date
is fixed), the Conversion Price of each of the Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E
Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such
increase of the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect
to such Common Stock Equivalents with the number of shares issuable with respect to Common

24275639_2.DOC 10

Stock Equivalents determined from time to time in the manner provided for deemed issuances in
Section 4(d)(i)(E).

(iii) Reverse Stock Splits. [f the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding at any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock without a corresponding combination of the Series A,
Series B, Series C and/or Series D Preferred Stock, then, following the record date of such
combination, the Conversion Price for each of the Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D and
Series E Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in
proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

(e) Other Distributions. In the event the Corporation shal] declare a
distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the
Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred
to in Section 4(d)(ii), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 4(e), the holders of
Series Preferred shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they
were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which their
shares of Series Preferred are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the
holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.

(f) Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall
be a recapitalization or reclassification of the Common Stock or the merger or consolidation of
the Corporation with or into another corporation or other entity (other than a Liquidation
Transaction as defined in Section 2 or a subdivision, combination or merger or sale of assets
transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4) provision shall be made so that the holders
of Series Preferred shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of such Series
Preferred the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or
otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been
entitled on such recapitalization, reclassification, merger, or consolidation. In any such case,
appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4 with
respect to the rights of the holders of such Series Preferred after the recapitalization,
reclassification, merger, or consolidation to the end that the provisions of this Section 4
(including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares
purchasable upon conversion of such Series Preferred) shall be applicable after that event and be
as nearly equivalent as practicable.

(g) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its
Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets,

(i) No fractional shares shal] be issued upon the conversion of
any share or shares of Series Preferred, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued
