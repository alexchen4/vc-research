Stock in one or more series, and in connection with the creation of any such series, by resolution

Three Million Five Hundred Thousand (3,500,000) of the authorized shares of Preferred
Stock are hereby designated “Series 1 Preferred Stock”, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Series

17201 19677353 vi 2

I Preferred”), and Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand (7,500,000) of the authorized shares
of Preferred Stock are hereby designated “Series A Preferred Stock”, $0.0001 par value per share
(the “Series A Preferred’).

The powers, preferences, rights, privileges and restrictions, qualifications and limitations
of the Preferred Stock are as follows:

1. Dividends

{aXi) The holders of shares of Series A Preferred will be entitled to
receive cumulative dividends at a rate equal to eight percent (8%) of the Series A Original Price
(hereafter defined) per share per annum (“Series A Cumulative Dividends”). “Series A Original
Price” wi}| mean $0.704 per share of Series A Preferred, which amount will be adjusted for any
stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or the like (collectively, “Recap Events”)
occurring after the date hereof. Prior to the occurrence of a Liquidating Event (as defined in
Section 2(c)) or a redemption of the Series A Preferred, Series A Cumulative Dividends will be
payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock at the Corporation’s option, provided, however,
that cash dividends shall be payable only out of funds that are legally available therefor, and if
such funds are not available, then such dividends shall be paid in additional shares of Common
Stock. The Series A Cumulative Dividends will be prior and in preference to any declaration or
payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities and rights
convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares
of Common Stock), distribution or payment of any kind on the Series | Preferred, the Common
Stock or any other equity securities of the Corporation (or securities convertible into equity
securities of the Corporation) other than the Series A Preferred, and will be payable when, as and
if declared by the Board. Unless otherwise required by law, Series A Cumulative Dividends will
accrue on each share of Series A Preferred commencing on the date of issue of such share,
whether or not earned or declared and whether or not there are profits, surplus or other funds of
‘the Corporation available for the payment of dividends.

(ii) Following payment of all dividends on the Series A
Preferred, the holders of shares of Series 1 Preferred will be entitled to receive cumulative
dividends at a rate equal to eight percent (8%) of the Series 1 Original Price (hereafter defined)
per share per annum (“Series 1 Cumulative Dividends”). “Series 1 Original Price” will mean
$0.50 per share of Series | Preferred, which amount will be adjusted for any Recap Events
occurring after the date hereof. Prior to the occurrence of a Liquidating Event (as defined in
Section 2(c)) or a redemption of the Series 1 Preferred, Series | Cumulative Dividends will be
payable in cash or in Common Stock at the option of the Corporation, provided, however, that
cash dividends shall be payable only out of funds that are legally available therefor, and if such
funds are not available, then such dividends shall be paid in additional shares of Common Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and following payment of all dividends on the Series A Preferred
as herein provided, in the event of any default in the redemption of the Series 1 Preferred
pursuant to this Certificate, the Series ! Cumulative Dividends shall increase to a rate equal to
twelve percent (12%) of the Series 1 Original Price per share per annum, but only during the
period of such default. The Series 1 Cumulative Dividends will be prior and in preference to any

ETZEL N9AT73ES vi 3

declaration or payment of any dividend (payable other than in Common Stock or other securities
and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly,
additional shares of Common Stock), distribution or payment of any kind on the Common Stock
or any other equity securities of the Corporation or securities convertible into equity securities of
the Corporation (other than the Series A Preferred and the Series 1 Preferred), and will be
payable when, as and if declared by the Board. Unless otherwise required by law, Series ]
Cumulative Dividends will accrue on each share of Series 1 Preferred commencing on the date of
issue of such share, whether or not earned or declared and whether or not there are profits,
surplus or other funds of the Corporation available for the payment of dividends.

(b) So long as any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding, the
Corporation shall not pay or declare any dividend, whether in cash or property, or make any other
distribution on the Common Stock, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for value any
shares of Common Stock until all dividends as set forth in Section 1(a}i) and (aii) on the
Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and set apart as set forth in Section (a)(i) and
(a)(ii), except for (i) acquisitions of Common Stock by the Corporation pursuant to agreements
which permit the Corporation to repurchase such shares upon termination of services to the
Corporation, which acquisitions have been approved by a majority of the Board, including a
majority of the directors elected by the holders of Series A Preferred, voting as a separate class,
or are in effect on the date of the filing hereof; and (ii) acquisitions of Common Stock in exercise
of the Corporation’s right of first refusal to repurchase such shares, which acquisitions have been
approved by a majority of the Board, including a majority of the directors elected by the holders
of Series A Preferred, voting as a separate class.

(c) If dividends are paid on any share of Common Stock, the
Corporation shal! pay an additional dividend on all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock in a per
share amount equal (on an as-if-converted to Common Stock basis) to the amount paid or set
aside for each share of Common Stock.

2. Liquidation

(a)i) Preference on Liquidation. Upon the occurrence of any Liquidating
Event, each holder of Series A Preferred then outstanding will be paid, out of the assets of the
Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment will be made in
respect of the Series | Preferred, the Common Stock, or any other equity securities of the
Corporation an amount equal to the Series A Original Price per share of Series A Preferred, plus
accrued dividends that are then unpaid for each share of Series A Preferred then held by it (the
“Series A Preference Amount’), subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any Recap
Event affecting such shares.

(ii) ‘If after payment of the Series A Preference Amount, any
assets of the Corporation remain legally available for distribution after the occurrence of a
Liquidating Event, then each holder of Series 1 Preferred then outstanding will be paid, out of the
assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment will be
made in respect of the Common Stock or any other equity securities of the Corporation, an

1720 1.19-$77313 vt 4

amount equal to the Series 1 Original Price per share of Series 1 Preferred, plus accrued
dividends that are then unpaid for each share of Series 1! Preferred then held by it (the “Series I
Preference Amount’, and together with the Series A Preference Amount, the “Preference
Amounts”), subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any Recap Event affecting such
shares.

(b) Payment on Liquidation.

(i) Written notice of any such Liquidating Event stating a
payment date, the place where such payment will be made, the amount of each payment in
liquidation and the amount of dividends to be paid will be given by first class mail, postage
prepaid, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each holder of
record of the Preferred Stock at such holder’s address as shown in the records of the Corporation,
provided that any holder of Preferred Stock may convert its shares of Preferred Stock to
Common Stock during such period at any time prior to the payment date stated in such notice.

(ii) ‘If, upon the occurrence of a Liquidating Event, the assets of
the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders will be insufficient to pay the
holders of the Series A Preferred the full Series A Preference Amount to which they will be
entitled, the holders of the Series A Preferred will share ratably in the distribution of all of the
Corporation’s assets (so that each holder receives the same percentage of the applicable Series A
Preference Amount per share). If the holders of the Series A Preferred have been paid their full
Series A Preference Amount per share of Series A Preferred as aforesaid, and the Corporation
has remaining assets but in an amount insufficient to pay the holders of the Series 1 Preferred the
full Series 1 Preference Amount to which they are entitled, the holders of the Series 1 Preferred
will share ratably in any distribution of the remaining assets (so that each holder receives the
same percentage of the applicable Series } Preference Amount per share).

(iii) After payment has been made to the holders of the
Preferred Stock of the full Preference Amounts, as aforesaid, any remaining assets will be
distributed ratably among the holders of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock as if such shares
of Preferred Stock had been converted voluntarily into Common Stock immediately prior to such
Liquidating Event.

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount to be
distributed to the holders of the Series 1 Preferred upon a Liquidating Event would be greater
than seven (7) times the Series | Original Price were the entire distribution made to the holders
of Common Stock and the holders of Series | Preferred (each share of which will be treated for
purposes of such distribution as the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share
could then be converted) and after taking into account the distribution to the holders of the Series
A Preferred, then each holder of Series 1 Preferred will receive, in lieu of receiving the Series |
Preference Amount, only its ratable share of the Corporation's assets as if such shares of such
Series 1 Preferred had been converted voluntarily into Common Stock at the then applicable
conversion rate immediately prior to such Liquidating Event.

$721 1.99-4793)3 v3

(c)  Liquidating Event. A “Liguidating Event’ will mean (i) any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, (ii) a
sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation to an
entity that is not controlled, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Corporation; for
purposes of this definition, “controf’ will mean ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of
the voting power of an entity or (iii) any transaction resulting in a change of control; for purposes
of this definition, a “change of controf” means that upon the close of a transaction (including,
without limitation, any transaction to which the Corporation is not a party, including, without
limitation, a share exchange and/or any transfer(s) of shares by one or more of the Corporation’s
stockholders as of the date hereof) in which the stockholders of the Corporation immediately
prior to the transaction hold less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the resulting
entity, or the grant of an exclusive license to all or substantially all of the Corporation's
intellectual property or technology; provided, however, if the holders of a majority of the shares
of Series A Preferred, voting as a single class, so elect by giving written notice to the Corporation
before the effective date of a transaction that would otherwise be a Liquidating Event, such
transaction will not be deemed a Liquidating Event for any purposes pursuant to this Certificate.

3. Voting

(a) Voting Rights. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or
as required by law, the holder of each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled to the number of
votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Preferred Stock
could then be converted and wil} have voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and
powers of the Common Stock (except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as required by
law, voting together with the Common Stock as a single class) and will be entitled to notice of
each stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation (the “Bylaws”).
Fractional votes will not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights resulting from
the above formula (after aggregating all shares of Common Stock into which shares of Preferred
Stock held by each holder could be converted) will be reduced to the nearest whole number.

(bo) Board. The Board will consist of five (5) directors, which will be
constituted as follows: (i) two (2) directors will be elected by the holders of a majority of the
Series A Preferred, voting together as a separate class, , (ii) two (2) directors will be elected by
the holders of a majority of the Common Stock, voting together as a separate class; provided,
however, that the directors to be elected by the holders of the Common Stock must be approved
by both directors elected by the holders of the Series A Preferred, and (iii) one (1) director wil] be
an independent, “outside” director elected by the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock and
the Common Stock, voting together as a single class. If the Corporation fails to redeem any
shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 8 at any time, then until such time, if ever, that the
Corporation cures such default, the Board will immediately consist of nine (9) directors; five (5)
of whom will be elected as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and the four (4)
additional directors wil) be elected by the holders of 66.7% of the Series A Preferred, voting
together as a separate class. In the case of any vacancy in the office of a director occurring
among the directors elected by the holders of a group described above, the remaining director so
elected by the holders of a majority in interest of such group may, or if there is no such director

37234,19-477313 vi 6


remaining, the holders of such group, voting as a group, will be entitled to appoint a successor or
successors to hold the office for the unexpired term of the director or directors whose place or
places will be vacant, Any director who will have been elected by the holders of a group
described above may be removed during his or her term of office, whether with or without cause

only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of such group.

(c) Protective Provisions of Series A Preferred. In addition to any
other rights provided by law or as set forth in this Certificate, so Jong as any shares of Series A
Preferred shal} remain outstanding, the Corporation will not, without first obtaining the
affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at least 66.7% of the then-outstanding shares
of Series A Preferred, consenting or voting separately as a class:

(i) take any action that alters or changes the powers, rights,
preferences or privileges of the Preferred Stock;

(ii) take any action that increases or decreases the total number
of authorized shares of the Preferred Stock;

(ii) | authorize or issue any new or existing class or classes or
series of capital stock having any preference or priority on parity with or senior to the Preferred
Stock as to dividends, liquidation, redemption, conversion, voting or assets, or authorize or issue
shares of stock of any class or any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations convertible into
or exchangeable for, or having option rights to purchase, any shares of stock of the Corporation
having any preference or priority on parity with or senior to the Preferred Stock as to dividends,
liquidation, redemption, conversion, voting or assets;

(iv) reclassify or recapitalize any outstanding capital stock of
the Corporation;

(v) amend, alter or repeal any provision of, or add any
provision to, this Certificate or the Bylaws then in effect (including, without limitation, any filing
of a Certificate of Designation), whether by merger, reclassification or otherwise;

(vi) pay or declare any dividend or distribution (other than a
dividend or distribution payable solely in the Corporation's capital stock) on any shares of its
capital stock (other than the Preferred Stock), or apply any of its assets to the redemption,
retirement, purchase or acquisition, directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries or otherwise, of
any shares of its capital stock, except for repurchases of shares from former employees, directors
or consultants pursuant to the terms of such former employees’, directors’ or consultants’ stock
purchase or restricted stock agreements providing for such repurchases at the original issuance
prices for such shares;

(vii) effectuate or permit to occur any Liquidating Event; or

(viii) undertake any public offering of the Corporation’s
securities other than a Qualified Initial Public Offering (hereafter defined).

17240,19-477313 v1 vi

4. Conyersion Rights

(a) Each share of Preferred Stock will be convertible at the option of
the holder thereof, at any time after the issuance of such share, into that number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is obtained by (i) multiplying the number of shares of
Preferred Stock to be so converted by the applicable Series A or Series 1 Original Price for such
shares of Preferred Stock and (ii) dividing the result by the “Series A Conversion Price” or the
Series 1 Conversion Price”, as applicable, in each case subject to adjustment as herein provided
(the “Conversion Price’’). The initial “Series A Conversion Price” will be the Series A Original
Price and the initial “Series I Conversion Price” will be the Series 1 Original Price, and shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time as herein provided.

(b) | The holder of any shares of Preferred Stock may exercise the
conversion rights as to such shares or any part thereof by delivering to the Corporation during
regular business hours, at the office of any transfer agent of the Corporation for the Preferred
Stock, or at the principal office of the Corporation or at such other place as may be designated by
the Corporation, the certificate or certificates for the shares to be converted, duly endorsed for
transfer to the Corporation or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer (if
required by it), accompanied by written notice stating that the holder elects to convert all or a
number of such shares represented by the certificate or certificates. Such notice will also state
such holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued. Conversion will be deemed to have been
effected on the date when such delivery is made, and such date is referred to herein as the
“Conversion Date’. As promptly as practicable thereafter the Corporation will issue and deliver
to such holder, at such office or other place designated by the Corporation, a certificate or
certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and a
check for cash with respect to any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock as provided in
Subsection 4(c) and the Corporation shall also remit to the holder of the Preferred Stock, in cash or
in Common Stock (at the Common Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the
Conversion Date), at the Company’s election, any accrued and unpaid or declared and unpaid
dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock being converted. The holder will be deemed to have
become a stockholder of record on the applicable Conversion Date. Upon conversion of only a
portion of the number of shares of Preferred Stock represented by a certificate surrendered for
conversion, the Corporation will issue and deliver to the holder of the certificate so surrendered
for conversion, at the expense of the Corporation, a new certificate covering the number of shares
of Preferred Stock representing the unconverted portion of the certificate so surrendered.

(c) —_No fractional shares of Common Stock or scrip will be issued upon
conversion of shares of Preferred Stock. If more than one share of Preferred Stock will be
surrendered for conversion at any one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof will be computed on the basis of the aggregate
number of shares of Preferred Stock so surrendered. Instead of any fractional shares of Common
Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock, the
Corporation will pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest equal to the fair
market value of such fractional interest as determined in good faith by the Board. The

3721 1.19-477313 v) 8

Corporation will pay any and all issue and other taxes that may be payable in respect of any issue
or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of Preferred Stock pursuant hereto. The
Corporation will not, however, be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any
transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that
in which the Preferred Stock so converted was registered, and no such issue or delivery will be
made unless and until the person requesting such issue has paid to the Corporation the amount of
any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(d) | The Corporation will at al] times reserve and keep available, out of
its authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of
Preferred Stock, the full number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the conversion of
all Preferred Stock from time to time outstanding. The Corporation will from time to time use its
best effort to obtain necessary director and stockholder approvals, in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, to increase the authorized amount of its Common Stock if at any time the
authorized amount of its Common Stock remaining unissued will not be sufficient to permit the
conversion of al] of the shares of Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, and will take all such
actions as are necessary to increase such authorized amount of Common Stock upon obtaining
such approvals.

(e) If the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of Preferred
Stock will be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of
stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision
or combination of shares or stock dividend provided for in Section 5(a) through (d)), then and in
each such event the holder of each share of Preferred Stock will have the right thereafter to
convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property
receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification, or other change, by holders of the number
of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock might have been
converted immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification, or change.

(fp In case of any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or
into another corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to
another corporation (other than a consolidation, merger or sale treated as a Liquidating Event
pursuant to Section 2(c)\ii) or (iii), each share of Preferred Stock will thereafter be convertible
into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property that a holder of the
number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of Preferred
Stock would have been entitled upon such consolidation, merger or sale; and in such case,
appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board) wil! be made in the application
of the provisions of this Section 4 and Section 5 with respect to the rights and interest thereafter
of the holders of Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in Sections 5 and 6 will
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other
property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.

(g) If any shares of Common Stock to be reserved for the purpose of

conversion of shares of Preferred Stock require registration or listing with, or approval of, any
governmental authority, stock exchange or other regulatory body under any federal or state law or

V2), 19-4773 13 vd 9

regulation or otherwise, before such shares may be validly issued or delivered upon conversion,

the Corporation will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible endeavor to secure such
registration, listing or approval, as the case may be.

(h) All shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon conversion
of the shares of Preferred Stock will upon issuance by the Corporation be validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issuance
thereof.

5. Adjustment of Conversion Price

The Conversion Price from time to time in effect will be subject to adjustment
from time to time as follows.

(a) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Corporation
shall at any time or from time to time after the date hereof effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock without a corresponding subdivision of the outstanding Preferred Stock, each
applicable Conversion Price then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be
proportionately decreased; conversely, if the Corporation shal] at any time or from time to time
after the date hereof reduce the outstanding shares of Common Stock by combination or
otherwise without a corresponding combination of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock,
each applicable Conversion Price then in effect immediately before the combination shall be
proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this Section 5(a) shall become effective at the
close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(b) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. If the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the date hereof shall make or issue, or fix a
record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or
other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the
applicable Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock then in effect shall be decreased as of the
time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of
business on such record date, by multiplying the applicable Conversion Price for each of the
Preferred Stock then in effect by a fraction:

(i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business
on such record date; and

(ii) the denominator of which shall be the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close
of business on such record date, plus the number of shares
of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution;

U7INA 9-477 vt 10

provided, however, if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid
or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the applicable Conversion
Price for the Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such
record date and thereafter the applicable Conversion Price for each series of the Preferred Stock

shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 5(b) as of the time of actual payment of such dividends
or distributions.

(c) Adjustments for Dividends and Distributions. If the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the date hereof shall make or issue, or fix a
record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common Stock,
then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred Stock shall
receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock
receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Corporation that they would have received
had such shares of Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event
and had thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including date of
conversion, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period giving
application to all adjustments called for during such period under this Section 5 with respect to
the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock.

(d) dj nt for Reclassification, Exchange or Substitution. If the
Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the
same or different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital
reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares or
stock dividend provided for above, or a reorganization or an event described in subsections (i) or
(ii) of the definition of Liquidating Event in Section 2(c) (a “Sale Transaction”) provided for
elsewhere in this Section 5), then and in each such event the holder of each share of Preferred
Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amounts of shares of
stock and other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification or
other change, by holders of the numbers of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of
Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization,
reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

(e) Adjustment for Reorganization, Mergers, Consolidations or Sales
of Assets. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a capital reorganization of the
Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares
provided for elsewhere in this Section 5) or a Sale Transaction to which the provisions of Section
2 hereof do not apply, and if as a part of such reorganization or Sale Transaction the Preferred
Stock is not cancelled, exchanged, redeemed or otherwise retired, then provision shall be made
so that each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shal] thereafter be entitled to receive upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of
the Corporation, or of the successor corporation resulting from such Sale Transaction to which a
holder of that number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such shares of
Preferred Stock would have been entitled on such capital reorganization or Sale Transaction. In
any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this

17218.19-477313 vd ] }

Section 5 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock after the reorganization
or Sale Transaction to the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including adjustment of the
applicable Conversion Price then in effect and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion

of the Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be
practicable.

case:

(i) the Corporation will take a record of the holders of its
Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or any other distribution,

Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock
of any class or to receive any other rights; or

(iii) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation,
reclassification of its capital stock (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding
shares of Common Stock), consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another
Corporation that is not a Liquidating Event or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets

then, and in any such case, the Corporation will cause to be mailed to the transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock and to the holders of record of the outstanding Preferred Stock, at least 10 days
prior to the date hereinafter specified, a notice stating the date on which (A) a record is to be
taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or (B) such reclassification,
reorganization, consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to
take place and the date, if any is to be fixed, as of which holders of Common Stock of record will
be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable
upon such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up.

(g) | Payment of Taxes. The Corporation will pay all taxes and other
governmental charges (other than taxes measured by the revenue or income of the holders of the
Preferred Stock) that may be imposed in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common
Stock upon conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock.

(h) No Dilution or Impairment. The Corporation shall not amend this
Certificate or participate in any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation,

assist in carrying out all such action as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to

§7231,29-877313 v1 12

protect the conversion rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock against dilution or other
impairment.

6. Mandatory Copversion

(a) Each share of Preferred Stock will automatically be converted into
shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price applicable to the shares of Preferred Stock
upon the occurrence of (i) a closing of a firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer
and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation to the public and raising net
proceeds of $30,000,000 or more at a price per share in such offer and sale of not Jess than eight
(8) times the Series A Original Price (that is, $5.63), as adjusted for any Recap Events occurring
after the date hereof (a “Qualified Initial Public Offering”), or (ii) the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least 66.67% of the Series A Preferred voting together as a single class. All holders
of record of shares of Preferred Stock will be given at least 20 days prior written notice of the
date fixed for mandatory conversion of the Preferred Stock and the event causing the mandatory
conversion of the Preferred Stock into Common Stock. Such notice will be sent by first class
mail, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of Preferred Stock at such holder’s address as
shown in the records of the Corporation. On or before the date so fixed for conversion, each
holder of shares of the Preferred Stock will surrender the certificate or certificates for all such
shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice and will thereafter receive
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled. The
mechanics for conversion and other provisions relating to conversion of Preferred Stock into
Common Stock set forth elsewhere in this Certificate will apply to the mandatory conversion of the
Preferred Stock, provided, however, that the Corporation shall also pay to the holder of the
Preferred Stock, in cash or, in Common Stock, at the Company’s election, (at the Common
Stock’s fair market value determined by the Board as of the date of such conversion), any
accrued and unpaid or declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock being
converted.

7. Issuances at Less Than the Applicable Conversion Price.

(a) ‘If at any time or from time to time after the date hereof, the
Corporation shall issue or sell, or is deemed by the express provisions of subsection (c) below to
have issued or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock (hereafter defined), other than in a
transaction to which Section 5(a) through (e) above applies, for a consideration per share less
than the applicable Conversion Price then in effect for a share of Preferred Stock, then the
applicable Conversion Price then in effect for such Preferred Stock shall be reduced as of the
opening of business on the date of such issue or sale, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying the then applicable Conversion Price for such Preferred Stock by a
fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be (A) the total number of shares of Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus (B) the total number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Convertible Securities
(hereafter defined) or Stock Purchase Rights, hereafter defined (the shares reflected in (A) and

17211.19-477313 v3 13

(B), collectively, “Outstanding Shares”), plus (C) the total number of shares of Common Stock
that the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at the Conversion Price applicable to such
Preferred Stock before this adjustment, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be (A) the total
number of Outstanding Shares immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus (B) the number of
such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued.

If the number of Additional Shares of Common Stock or the aggregate consideration for such
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock cannot be ascertained at the time of issuance,
such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed issued immediately upon the
occurrence of the first event that makes such number of shares or the aggregate consideration, as
applicable, determinable.

(b) For the purpose of making any adjustment in the applicable
Conversion Price or number of shares of Common Stock purchasable on conversion of Preferred
Stock as provided above, the consideration received by the Corporation for the issuance, sale,
grant or assumption of shares of Common Stock, Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible
Securities, irrespective of the accounting treatment of such consideration, will be valued as
follows:

(i) Cash Payment. In the case of cash, the net amount received
by the Corporation after deduction of any accrued interest or dividends and
after deducting any expenses paid or incurred and any underwriting
commissions or concessions paid or allowed by the Corporation in
connection with such issue or sale;

(ii) | Noncash Payment. In the case of consideration other than
cash, the value of such consideration, including the value of any loan made
in connection with the issuance of Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible
Securities, which will not include the value of any Convertible Securities
being converted or exchanged, as determined by the Board in good faith,
after deducting any accrued interest or dividends; and

(iii) Stock Purchase Rights and Convertible Securities. The
total consideration, if any, received by the Corporation as consideration for
the issuance of the Stock Purchase Rights or the Convertible Securities, as
the case may be, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such
Stock Purchase Rights or upon the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, as the case may be, in each case after deducting
any accrued interest or dividends.

(iv) | Where as part of the same transaction or series of related

transactions occurring within a sixty (60) day period more than one type of
Convertible Securities and/or Stock Purchase Rights or both Convertible

UT219.19-477313 vd 14

Securities and Stock Purchase Rights are issued, the determination as to
whether an issuance of securities pursuant to Section 7(a) has occurred
will be made on an aggregate basis, taking into account all Convertible
Securities and all Stock Purchase Rights whose conversion or exercise are
conditioned on the conversion or exercise of the other Convertible
Securities and Stock Purchase Rights.

(c) For the purpose of the adjustment provided in Section 7(a), if at
any time or from time to time after the date hereof, the Corporation shall issue any Stock
Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities (hereafter defined), then in each case, if the Subsection
(c) Effective Price (hereafter defined) of such warrants, options, rights or Convertible Securities
shall be less than the then applicable Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock, the Corporation
shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the issuance of such Stock Purchase Rights or
Convertible Securitics the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise or conversion thereof and to have received as consideration for the issuance of
such shares an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any, received by the
Corporation for the issuance of such Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities, plus, in the
case of such Stock Purchase Rights, the minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to
the Corporation upon exercise or conversion of such Stock Purchase Rights. For purposes of the
foregoing, “Subsection (c) Effective Price” sha\l mean the quotient determined by dividing the
total of al] such consideration by such maximum number of Additional Shares of Common
Stock. No further adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price adjusted upon the issuance of
such Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities shall be made as a result of the actual
issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock on the exercise of any such Stock Purchase
Rights or the conversion of any such Convertible Securities.

If any such Stock Purchase Rights or the conversion privilege represented by any such
Convertible Securities shall expire without having been exercised, the applicable Conversion
Price adjusted upon the issuance of such Stock Purchase Rights or Convertible Securities shall be
readjusted to the applicable Conversion Price that would have been in effect had an adjustment
been made on the basis that the only Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued were the
Additional Shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold on the exercise of such Stock
Purchase Rights, or rights of conversion of such Convertible Securities, and such Additional
Shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration received by the
Corporation upon such exercise, plus the consideration, if any, actually received by the
Corporation for the granting of all such Stock Purchase Rights, whether or not exercised, plus the
consideration received for issuing or selling the Convertible Securities actually converted plus
the consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation on the conversion of such
Convertible Securities.

{d) For the purpose of the adjustment provided for in Section 7(a), if at
any time or from time to time after the date hereof the Corporation shall issue any rights or
options for the purchase of Convertible Securities, then in each such case, if the Subsection (d)
Effective Price (hereafter defined) thereof is less than the current applicable Conversion Price of
a series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall be deemed to have issued at the time of the

V7ZU0.19-477313 v1 15

issuance of such rights or options the maximum number of Additional Shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the total amount of Convertible Securities covered by such rights or
options and to have received as consideration for the issuance of such Additional Shares of
Common Stock an amount equal to the amount of consideration, if any, received by the
Corporation for the issuance of such rights or options, plus the minimum amounts of
consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the conversion of such Convertible
Securities. For purposes of the foregoing, “Subsection (d) Effective Price” shall mean the
quotient determined by dividing the total amount of such consideration by such maximum
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock. No further adjustment of such Conversion
Price adjusted upon the issuance of such rights or options shall be made as a result of the actual
issuance of the Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such rights or options, or upon the
actual issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of such Convertible
Securities.

The provisions of subsection (c) above for the readjustment of such applicable
Conversion Price upon the expiration of rights or options or the rights of conversion of
Convertible Securities, shall apply muratis mutandis to the rights, options and Convertible
Securities referred to in this subsection (d).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicable Conversion Price will be reduced at such time if
such reduction would be an amount less than $0.001, but any such amount will be carried
forward and deduction with respect thereto made at the time of and together with any subsequent
reduction that, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward,
will aggregate $0,001 or more.

(e) For purposes of this Section 7, the following provisions will be
applicable:

(i) The term “Additional Shares of Common Stock” as used
herein shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued or deemed issued by the Corporation after
the date hereof, whether or not subsequently reacquired or retired by the Corporation, other than
the issuance of shares of the Corporation’s capital stock pursuant to subsection (f), “Exclusions”,
below.

(ii) “Convertible Securities” will mean evidences of
indebtedness, shares of stock (including, without limitation, the Preferred Stock) or other
securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, with or without payment of additional
consideration, Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(iii) “Stock Purchase Rights” wil] mean any warrants, options
or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of Common Stock or
any Convertible Securities.

(iv) Convertible Securities and Stock Purchase Rights will be
deemed outstanding and issued or sold at the time of such issue or sale.

17215.19-477313 vl 16

(f) Exclusions. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Corporation will not be required to make any adjustment of the Conversion Price in the case of
(i) the issuance or sale of Common Stock or of options (or restricted stock awards), or the shares
of stock issuable upon exercise of such options, to purchase up to 3,323,506 shares, subject to
adjustment for Recap Events, to directors, officers, employees or consultants of the Corporation
pursuant to stock options or stock purchase plans or agreements, whether “qualified” for tax
purposes or not, pursuant to plans or arrangements approved by the Board, (ii) the issuance or
sale of Common Stock pursuant to a Qualified Initial Public Offering, (iii) the issuance or sale of
Common Stock or the sale of warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (or shares of
Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of such warrants) to the Corporation’s strategic partners
or in connection with other strategic transactions in an amount not to exceed five percent (5%) of
the Common Stock, as calculated on a fully diluted basis, if such issuance and sale is approved
by the Board (such approval shall include at least one of the directors elected by the holders of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock), (iv) the issuance or sale of warrants to purchase shares of
Common Stock (or shares of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of such warrants) to the
Corporation’s lenders and/or equipment lessors in an amount not to exceed one percent (1%) of
the Common Stock, as calculated on a fully diluted basis, if such issuance and sale is approved
by the Board (such approval shall include at least one of the directors elected by the holders of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock), (v) the issuance of Common Stock upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock and any warrants issued and outstanding the date of the first sale of Series A
Preferred Stock for shares of Preferred Stock, or (vi) the issuance of any shares of the
Corporation's capital stock upon the conversion or exercise of Stock Purchase Rights or
Convertible Securities, the issuance of which was subject to the provisions of Section 7(a) above
or was excluded therefrom pursuant to this Section 7(f); provided, however, that the holders of
66.7% of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock may waive on behalf of all holders of Preferred
Stock any adjustments otherwise applicable pursuant to this Section 7. The issuances or sales
described in the preceding clauses (i) through (vi) will be ignored for purposes of calculating any
adjustment to any Conversion Price.

(2) Notice of Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the applicable Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 7, the Corporation at its
expense wil] promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms
thereof, and prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock affected thereby a certificate
setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation will, upon the written notice at any time of
any holder of Preferred Stock furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate
setting forth (i) such adjustment or readjustment, (ii) the applicable Conversion Price at the time
in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other
property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of such holder’s shares.

8. Redemption.
(a) Mandatory Redemption. Subject to the terms and conditions of this

Section 8, including, but not limited to, subsection (d) below, the Corporation shall, upon
receiving at any time on or after the fifth (sy anniversary of the date of the first sale of Series A

97211, 19-477313 vi 17

Preferred Stock, a written request (a “Redemption Notice”) for the redemption of the outstanding
shares of a series of Preferred Stock under this Section 8 signed by the holders of at least 66.67%
of then outstanding shares of such series, redeem any such outstanding shares of such series (the
“Redemption Shares’) within thirty (30) days after the date set forth in such Redemption Notice
(the “Redemption Date”), in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 8. The
Corporation shal] redeem the Redemption Shares from any source of funds legally available
therefor at the applicable Redemption Price (as defined in Section 8(b)), until all outstanding
Redemption Shares have been redeemed (or converted to Common Stock) from the holders
thereof (the “Redeeming Holders”).

(b) Redemption Price. The redemption price (the “Redemption
Price”) for each share of Preferred Stock shall be the Series A Original Price or the Series |
Original Price applicable to such share of Preferred Stock, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends
on each such share through the Redemption Date.

(c) Redemption Closings. In the event of any redemption in
accordance with this Section 8, the Corporation shal] purchase, and the Redeeming Holders shall
sell, the Redemption Shares on the Redemption Date (the “Redemption Closing”). The
Corporation shall notify in writing al] Redeeming Holders of the date and place of the
Redemption Closing at least seven (7) days prior to such Redemption Closing. At the
Redemption Closing, the Redeeming Holders shall deliver to the Corporation certificates
representing the Redemption Shares held by such Redeeming Holders. If less than all of the
shares represented by such certificate are redeemed, then the Corporation shall promptly issue a
new certificate representing the unredeemed shares. The Corporation shall deliver to each
Redeeming Holder the Redemption Price for each share of Preferred Stock to be sold to the
Corporation at the Redemption Closing in cash (by cashier’s or certified check or by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by such holder).

(4) Redemption Funds; Priority of Redemptions. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, no Redemption Notice shall be effective in respect of
the Series 1 Preferred unless and until a Redemption Notice has been received in respect of the
Series A Preferred. If on any date on which shares of a series of Preferred Stock are to be
redeemed, funds of the Corporation legally available therefor shall be insufficient to redeem al]
of the Redemption Shares required to be redeemed as provided for herein on such date, funds to
the extent legally available to redeem only such Redemption Shares, shall be used for such
purpose and the Corporation shall redeem the Redemption Shares held by the holders of Series A
Preferred out of any funds and assets of the Corporation legally available therefor. If funds of the
Corporation legally available therefor shall be insufficient to redeem all of the Series A Preferred
required to be redeemed as provided for herein on such date, then the Series A Preferred shall be
redeemed on a pro rata basis determined by multiplying the Redemption Price payable to the
holders of Series A Preferred by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares
of Series A Preferred held by such Redeeming Holder and the denominator of which shall be the
aggregate number of all shares of Series A Preferred held by all Redeeming Holders. After all
shares of Series A Preferred have been redeemed by the Corporation, the holders of the then

V72V1.19-477333 vi 18

outstanding shares of Series 1 Preferred shal} be entitled to have their shares of Series 1 Preferred
redeemed, out of any funds and assets of the Corporation legally available therefor. If funds of
the Corporation legally available therefor shall be insufficient to redeem all of the shares of
Series 1 Preferred required to be redeemed as provided for herein on such date, then the shares of
Series 1 Preferred shall be redeemed on a pro rata basis determined by multiplying the
Redemption Price payable to the holders of shares of Series 1 Preferred by a fraction the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Series 1 Preferred held by such Redeeming
Holder and the denominator of which shal] be the aggregate number of shares of Series }
Preferred held by all Redeeming Holders.

(e) Effect of Redemption. If a Redemption Notice shall have been
duly given, and if on a Redemption Closing the applicable Redemption Price is either paid in full
or made available for immediate payment in full, then notwithstanding that the certificates
evidencing any of the shares of Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not have been
surrendered, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue after the date of the
applicable Redemption Closing, such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the
Corporation’s books and all rights of the holders of such shares with respect to such shares shall
terminate after such Redemption Closing, except only the right of the holders to receive the
applicable Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate(s) therefor.

9. Events of Non-Compliance.

(a) Remedies Upon _an Event _of Non-Compliance. Upon the
occurrence of an Event of Non-Compliance (hereafter defined), at least one of the holders of
Series A Preferred must provide written notice to the Corporation and each of the other holders
of the Preferred Stock of such occurrence (using such addresses as are then current on the books
and records of the Corporation). The Corporation will have fifteen (15) days from the date of
such notice to remedy the Event of Non-Compliance; provided, however, that no such remedy
shall be required upon the consent of the holders of at least two-thirds (66-2/3%) in interest of
the then outstanding Series A Preferred to waive their rights under this Section 9 with respect to
such Event of Non-Compliance. If after such fifteen (15) day period, the Corporation has not
cured the Event of Non-Compliance and no such waiver has been provided, then in addition to
any dividends otherwise payable on the Series A Preferred, from and after the date of such Event
of Non-Compliance, in addition to those provided for pursuant to Section 1(a){i), dividends will
accrue and be payable with respect to the Series A Preferred quarterly at the rate of ten percent
(10%) per annum on the Series A Original Issue Price until the Event of Non-Compliance is
cured by the Corporation or waived by the holders of at least two-thirds (66-2/3%) in interest of
the then outstanding Series A Preferred, and any holder of Series A Preferred will have the right
to convert any such accrued and unpaid dividends into shares of Common Stock at the then
current and applicable Series A Conversion Price.

(b) | The remedies provided for in this Section 9 will be in addition to

any other rights and remedies under applicable law, in equity, or provided for in or contemplated
by any agreements between the Corporation and any holders of Series A Preferred and will be

1725112477313 vi 19

cumulative and non-exclusive with any such other rights and remedies and in the event of any
actual conflict or inconsistency herewith and therewith, the terms set forth above shall control,
unless otherwise agreed to by the holders of at least two-thirds (66-2/3%) in interest of the then
outstanding Series A Preferred.

(c) Definition. An “Event of Non-Compliance” will occur if, without
the waiver, consent or acquiescence of the holders of at least a two-thirds (66-2/3rds%) of the

representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in the Series A Preferred Stock

Corporation fails to make any mandatory redemption as required in Section 8 above, or to pay
any dividend with respect to the Series A Preferred as required herein, in each case when due;
(iii) there occurs an “event of defaulf’ (as defined in the applicable agreement evidencing any
Material Loan (hereafter defined); provided that if there is no definition of “event of defaulf’ in
such agreement, then an event of default shall mean a material default under such agreement)
under any loan agreement where the outstanding balance (principal, interest and costs and fees)
exceeds $50,000 (a “Material Loan”), and such default is not timely cured or waived in
accordance with the applicable loan documents; or (iv) the Corporation (A) files for bankruptcy,
