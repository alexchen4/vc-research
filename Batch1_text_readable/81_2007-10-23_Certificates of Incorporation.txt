case such event shall not be a Deemed Liquidation Event: (i) the merger or consolidation of the

shall occur, the Corporation shall promptly give each holder of Series B Preferred Stock and
Series A Preferred Stock written notice of such material change. The Corporation shall not
consummate any such proposed Jiquidation, dissolution or winding up before the expiration of
thirty (30) days after the mailing of the initial notice or twenty (20) days after the mailing of any
subsequent written notice, whichever is later, provided that any such 30-day or 20-day period
may be shortened or waived upon the written consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of each of the Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series A
Preferred Stock. Any holder of outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock may waive any notice required by this Subsection by
a written instrument specifically indicating such waiver.

Section 2. Conversion. The holders of Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock and Series A Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the "Conversion
Rights"):

(a) Right to Convert; Conversion Price. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock,
Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible, without the payment
of any additional consideration by the holder thereof and at the option of the holder thereof, at
any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer
agent for the Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock,
into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by
dividing $2.60, in the case of the Series C Preferred Stock, $1.85, in the case of the Series B
Preferred Stock, and $1.00, in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock, (in each case, subject to
equitable adjustment whenever there shall occur a change in the capital structure of the Series C
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, respectively) by the
Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price and Series A Conversion Price,
respectively, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of conversion. The Series
C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price and Series A Conversion Price at which shares of
Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of Series C Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, respectively, without the payment of any
additional consideration by the holder thereof (respectively, the "Series C Conversion Price,"
“Series B Conversion Price” and "Series A Conversion Price") shall initially be $2.60 per share
of Common Stock for the Series C Preferred Stock, $1.85 per share of Common Stock for the
Series B Preferred Stock and $1.00 per share of Common Stock for the Series A Preferred Stock.
Such initial Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price and Series A Conversion Price
shall be subject to adjustment, in order to adjust the number of shares of Common Stock into
which the Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock is
convertible, as hereinafter provided.

The right of conversion with respect to any shares of Preferred Stock which shall have
been called for redemption under Section 6 hereof shall terminate at the close of business on the
day fixed for redemption unless the Corporation shall default in the payment of the redemption
price, in which case the right of conversion with respect to such shares shall continue unless and
until such redemption price is paid in full.

10748320_4.DOC

(bo) Automatic Conversion.

(i) Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into
shares of Common Stock at the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series
C Conversion Price, as the case may be, then in effect upon the closing of a firm commitment
underwritten public offering led by a investment banking firm acceptable to the holders of two-
thirds of the then outstanding Series C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, voting
together as a single class, pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of Common Stock for the account of the
Corporation to the public at an offering price per share of not less than $3.70 per share, if such
public offering is closed on or before March 31, 2009, or $5.55 per share, if such public offering
is closed after March 31, 2009 (in each case as adjusted to reflect any stock dividends,
distributions, combinations, reclassifications or other like transactions effected by the
Corporation in respect of its Common Stock) and with gross proceeds to the Corporation of not
less than $50,000,000 (prior to underwriters' discounts and commissions) (in the event of which
offering, the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of
the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted the Preferred Stock until the closing
of such offering). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Preferred Stock shall not be
subject to automatic conversion pursuant to this Section 2(b)(i) in connection with an
underwritten public offering that otherwise meets the requirements of this Section 2(b)(i) (x)
after March 31, 2009 at an offering price per share that is between $3.70 and $5.55 (as adjusted
to reflect any stock dividends, distributions, combinations, reclassifications or other like
transactions effected by the Corporation in respect of its Common Stock), unless the holders of at
least two-thirds of the then outstanding Series C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock,
voting together as a single class, shall have consented to such automatic conversion; or (y) at an
offering price per share that is less than $3.70 (as adjusted to reflect any stock dividends,
distributions, combinations, reclassifications or other like transactions effected by the
Corporation in respect of its Common Stock), unless the holders of at least two-thirds of the then
outstanding Series B Preferred Stock and the holders of at least 70% of the then outstanding
Series C Preferred Stock, each voting as a separate class, shall have consented to such automatic
conversion.

(ii) In addition to the requirements of Section 2(b){i) in connection
with an underwritten public offering, each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common
Stock at the Series A Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price and Series C Preferred Stock
Conversion Price then in effect, as the case may be, upon the written election of the holders of at
least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, to require such mandatory conversion.

(c) Mechanics of Automatic Conversions. Upon the occurrence of an event
specified in Subsection 2(b), the applicable series of Preferred Stock shall be converted
automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent;
provided, however, that all holders of shares of Preferred Stock being converted shall be given

10748320_4.DOC

written notice of the occurrence of the event specified in Subsection 2(b) triggering such
conversion, including the date such event occurred (the "Mandatory Conversion Date"), and the

' Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion unless certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock
being converted are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, or the holder notifies
the Corporation or any transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed
and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from
any loss incurred by it in connection therewith. On the Mandatory Conversion Date, all rights
with respect to the applicable series of Preferred Stock so converted shall terminate, except any
of the rights of the holder thereof, upon surrender of the holder's certificate or certificates
therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock into which such series
of Preferred Stock has been converted, together with cash in an amount equal to all dividends
declared but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts owing with respect to, the shares of
Preferred Stock converted to and including the time of conversion. Upon the automatic
conversion of the Preferred Stock, the holders of such Preferred Stock shall surrender the
certificates representing such shares at the office of the Corporation or of its transfer agent. If so
required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or
accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by the holder’s attorney duly authorized in
writing. Upon surrender of such certificates there shall be issued and delivered to such holder, or
to such holder’s nominee or nominees promptly at such office, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock surrendered were
convertible on the date on which such automatic conversion occurred, together with cash in an
amount equal to all dividends declared but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts owing with
respect to, the shares of Preferred Stock converted to and including the time of conversion. Upon
the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock, all shares of Preferred Stock being converted by
any holder thereof shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock
shall be issued. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled,
the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the Mandatory Conversion Date, as reasonably determined by the Board of
Directors in good faith.

(d) Mechanics of Optional Conversions. Before any holder of Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, the holder shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the
Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that the holder
elects to convert the same and shall state therein the holder's name or the name or names of the
holder's nominees in which the holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock to be issued. On the date of conversion, all rights with respect to the Preferred Stock so
converted shall terminate, except any of the rights of the holder thereof, upon surrender of the
holder's certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted and cash in an amount equal
to all dividends declared but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts owing with respect to, the
shares of Preferred Stock being converted to and including the time of conversion. If so required
by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by

10748320_4.DOC

written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or by the holder's attorney duly authorized in writing. Upon
the optional conversion of the Preferred Stock, all shares of Preferred Stock being converted by
any holder thereof shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock
shall be issued. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled,
the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the date of conversion, as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors in
good faith. The Corporation shall, promptly after surrender of the certificate or certificates for
conversion, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to the holder's
nominee or nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which the holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a
share and cash in an amount equal to all dividends declared but unpaid thereon and any and all
other amounts owing with respect thereto at such time. Unless otherwise specified by the holder
in the written notice of conversion, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock on such date.

Common Stock (a) unless the consideration per share for an Additional Share of Common Stock
(determined pursuant to Subsection 2(e){v)) issued or deemed to be issued by the Corporation is
less than the Series C Conversion price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price,
respectively, in effect on the date of, and immediately prior to, the issue of such Additional Share
of Common Stock or (b) if prior to such issuance or within twenty (20) days thereafter the

(iii) Issue of Securities Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common
Stock.

any Options (excluding for all purposes of this Subsection 2(eX{iii)(1) Options excluded from the
definition of Additional Shares of Common Stock in Subsection 2(e){i)(4)(B)) or Convertible
Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities
entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of

therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares
of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have
been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, and the Series C Conversion Price,
Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be adjusted
accordingly, provided that in any such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are
deemed to be issued:

(A) no further adjustment in the Series C Conversion
Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price shall be made upon the
subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of such
Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(B) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms
provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase in the consideration payable to
the Corporation, or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable, upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion
Price or Series A Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the
occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon,
shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such
increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange
under such Convertible Securities;

(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights
of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been
exercised, the Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion

respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be
recomputed as if:

(1) In the case of Convertible Securities or Options
for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the
consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or

10748320_4.DOC
10

not exercised, plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or
for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus
the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion
or exchange; and

(II) in the case of Options for Convertible
Securities only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were
issued at the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for
the Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration
actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised,
plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to
Subsection 2(e)(v)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such
Options were actually exercised;

(D) no readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above
shall have the effect of increasing the Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or
Series A Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Series C Conversion
Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price on the original adjustment date, or
(ii) the Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price that
would have resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the

business on such record date, and thereafter the Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion
Price or Series A Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Subsection 2(e)(iii) as of the
actual date of their issuance.

event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall declare
or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on the Common Stock payable in Common
Stock or effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or
otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock), then and in any such event,
Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued with respect to the
Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock:

(A) in the case of any such dividend or distribution,

If such record date shall have been fixed and no part of such dividend or distribution shall
have been paid on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in the Series B
Conversion Price and Series A Conversion Price which became effective on such record date
shall be canceled as of the close of business on such record date, and thereafter the Series C
Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price and Series A Conversion Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this Subsection 2(e)(iii) as of the time of actual payment of such dividend or

2(e)(iii)(1) but excluding Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to
Subsection 2(e)(iii)(2), which event is dealt with in Subsection 2(e)(vi)(1)), without
consideration or for a consideration per share Jess than the Series C Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price in effect on the date of and immediately prior to
such issue, then and in such event, such Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or
Series A Conversion Price, as applicable, shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a
price (calculated to the nearest one tenth of one cent) determined in accordance with the
following formula:

NCP = wnwnnnneneernnnnnneneeee-a-

10748320_4.DOC

Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable,
outstanding immediately prior to such issue shall be deemed to be outstanding, and immediately
after any Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed issued pursuant to Subsection
2(e)(iii), such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(v) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Subsection 2(e),
the consideration received by the Corporation for the issue of any Additional Shares of Common
Stock shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property: Such consideration shall:

(A) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the
aggregate amounts of cash received by the Corporation excluding amounts paid or payable for
accrued interest or accrued dividends;

(B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be
computed at the fair value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors; and

(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are
issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration
which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per
share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been
issued pursuant to Subsection 2(e){iii)(1), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be
determined by dividing (x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto,
without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the
exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities, by (y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in
the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a
subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price and Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately before such deemed issuance shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
deemed issuance, be proportionately decreased.

(2) Combinations or Consolidations. In the event the outstanding
shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise,
into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Series C Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price and Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination
or consolidation shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation,
be proportionately increased.

(f) Adjustments for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event that at any
time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Corporation shall make or issue, or fix
a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common Stock or
securities the issuance of which are deemed to be issuances of Common Stock under Subsection
2(e)(iii), then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of Preferred
Stock shall receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of Common
Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Corporation that they would have
received had their Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such
event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the
conversion date, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during such period,
giving application during such period to all adjustments called for herein.

(g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange, or Substitution. In the event that
at any time or from time to time after the applicable Original Issue Date the Common Stock
issuable upon the conversion of the applicable Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or
a different number of shares of any class or series of stock or other securities or property,
whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise (other than a
subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend provided for above, or a merger,
consolidation, or sale of assets provided for below), then and in each such event the holder of
any shares of the applicable Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares
into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon
such reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other change by the holder of a number
of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such
shares of the applicable Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or change, all subject to further adjustment as
provided herein.

10748320_4.DOC

(h) Adjustment for Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets. Subject to the
provisions of Subsection 1(c), in the event that, at any time or from time to time after the
applicable Original Issue Date, the Corporation shall merge or consolidate with or into another
entity or sell all or substantially all of its assets, and such consolidation, merger or sale is not
treated as a liquidation under Subsection 1(c), each share of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be
convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property to which a
holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon
conversion of such Preferred Stock would have been entitled to receive upon such consolidation,
merger or sale; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions set forth in this Section 2
with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the holders of shares of such Preferred Stock,
to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 2 (including provisions with respect to
changes in and other adjustments of the Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price
and Series A Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in
relation to any shares of stock or other securities or property thereafter deliverable upon the
conversion of such Preferred Stock.

(i) Special Mandatory Conversion.

(i) In the event that any holder of shares of Preferred Stock does not
participate in a Qualified Financing (as defined below) by purchasing in the aggregate, in such
Qualified Financing and within the time period specified by the Corporation (provided that the
Corporation has given such holder at least ten (10) days written notice of the Qualified
Financing), such holder’s Pro Rata Amount (as defined below), then the Applicable Portion of
the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder shall automatically, and without any further
action on the part of such holder, be converted into shares of Common Stock at the applicable
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the consummation of such Qualified Financing,
effective upon, subject to, and concurrently with, the consummation of the Qualified Financing.
For purposes of determining the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned by a holder, and for
determining the number of Offered Securities a holder of Preferred Stock has purchased in a
Qualified Financing, all shares of Preferred Stock held by Affiliates of such holder shall be
aggregated with such holder’s shares and all Offered Securities purchased by Affiliates of such
holder shall be aggregated with the Offered Securities purchased by such holder (provided that
no shares or securities shall be attributed to more than one entity or person within any such group
of affiliated entities or persons). Any such conversion is sometimes hereinafter referred to as a
“Special Mandatory Conversion.”

(ii) | Upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, each holder of shares of
Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 2(i)(i) shall surrender his, her or its certificate or
certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall
thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Section 2(i) and a new certificate for the number of shares, if any, of
Preferred Stock represented by such surrendered certificate and not converted pursuant to
Section 2(1)(i). If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shal] be
endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to
the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by the holder's attomey duly

10748320_4.D0C
15

authorized in writing. All rights with respect to the Preferred Stock converted pursuant to
Section 2(1)(i) shall terminate, except any of the rights of the holder thereof, upon surrender of
the holder's certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock has been converted, together with cash in an
amount equal to all dividends declared but unpaid on, and any and all other amounts owing with
respect to, the shares of Preferred Stock converted to and including the time of conversion, and a
new certificate for the number of shares, if any, of Preferred Stock represented by such
surrendered certificate and not converted pursuant to Section 2(i)(i). Upon the conversion of
shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2(i)(i), all shares of Preferred Stock of any holder
thereof shall be aggregated for the purpose of determining the number of shares of Common
Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, and no fractional share of Common Stock shall be
issued. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the
Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the date of such conversion, as reasonably determined by the Board of
Directors in good faith.

(iii) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are
required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from
and after the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have been retired and
cancelled, and the shares of Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 2(i){i) represented
thereby shall, from and after the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion, be deemed to have
been converted into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or
holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date. The Corporation may
thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be
necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of the applicable series of Preferred Stock
accordingly.

(iv) For purposes of this Section 2(i), the following definitions shall
apply:

(1) “Affiliate” shall mean, with respect to any holder of shares
of Preferred Stock, any person, entity or firm which, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled
by or is under common control with such holder, including, without limitation, any entity of

such holder and any venture capital fund now or hereafter existing of which the holder is a
partner or member which is controlled by or under common control with one or more general
partners of such holder or shares the same management company with such holder.

(2) “Applicable Portion” shall mean, with respect to any holder
of shares of Preferred Stock, a number of shares of Preferred Stock calculated by multiplying the
aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder immediately prior to a
Qualified Financing by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the amount, if positive, by
which such holder’s Pro Rata Amount exceeds the number of Offered Securities actually
purchased by such holder in such Qualified Financing, and the denominator of which is equal to
such holder’s Pro Rata Amount.

10748320_4.DOC

(3) “Offered Securities” shall mean the equity securities of the
Corporation set aside by the Board of Directors for purchase by holders of outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock in connection with a Qualified Financing, and offered to such holders.

of Preferred Stock, the lesser of (a) the number of Offered Securities that such holder is entitled
to purchase pursuant to Section 3 of the Amended and Restated Investor Rights Agreement dated
on or about the Original Issue Date of the Series B Preferred Stock, as amended from time to
time (the “Investor Rights Agreement”), or (b) the maximum number of Offered Securities that
such holder is permitted by the Corporation to purchase in such Qualified Financing, after giving
effect to any cutbacks or limitations established by the Board of Directors or the other parties to
the Investor Rights Agreement pursuant to a waiver or modification thereof and applied on a pro
rata basis to all holders of Preferred Stock.

(5) “Qualified Financing” shall mean, with respect to the

sale of equity securities of the Corporation after the applicable Original] Issue Date which would
result in the reduction of the Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A
Conversion Price, respectively, pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Incorporation (giving
effect to the operation of Section 2(e)(ii)(b) hereof).

(j) No Impairment. The Corporation shall not, by amendment of its Certificate of
Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger,
dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the
observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the
Corporation but shall at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of
this Section 2 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to
protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against impairment.

(k) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Series C Conversion Price, Series B Conversion Price or Series A
Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 2, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly
compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to
each holder of Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as
applicable, a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the
facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the
written request at any time of any holder of Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or

forth (1) such adjustments and readjustments, (11) the Series C Conversion Price, Series B
Conversion Price or Series A Conversion Price, as applicable, at the time in effect, and (iii) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time
would be received upon the conversion of each share of Series C Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable.

shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock at least ten (10) days prior to such record date a
notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend or distribution.

(m) Common Stock Reserved. The Corporation shall reserve and keep available,
free from pre-emptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the
purpose of effecting the conversion of Preferred Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock
as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect conversion of the Preferred Stock. If at any time
the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect
the conversion of all the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall
promptly take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to
increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall
be sufficient for such purpose.

(n) Certain Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any issue or transfer taxes payable
in connection with the conversion of Preferred Stock, provided, however, that the Corporation
shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer to a name
other than that of the holder of the Preferred Stock.

(o) Closing of Books. The Corporation shall at no time close its transfer books

timely conversion or transfer of such Preferred Stock or Common Stock.

(p) Validity of Shares. The Corporation agrees that it will from time to time take
all such actions as may be required to assure that all shares of Common Stock which may be
issued upon conversion of any Preferred Stock will, upon issuance, be legally and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue
thereof.

Corporation. Within five (5S) business days after written application by the holders of not less
than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding Preferred Stock, the President or Secretary, or such
other officer of the Corporation as may be authorized in the By-Laws of the Corporation to give
notice of meetings of stockholders of the Corporation, shal] notify each stockholder of the
Corporation entitled to such notice of the date, time, place and purpose of such meeting.

(f) The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or

Section 5. Dividends.

(a) Dividends may be declared and paid on Common Stock from funds lawfully

Stock or Series B Preferred Stock until all dividends accrued or declared but unpaid on the Series
C Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full; and provided further that no dividends shall be
declared or paid on shares of Common Stock unless the Corporation shall declare and pay at the
same time to each holder of Preferred Stock a dividend equal to the dividend which would have
been payable to such holder if the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder had been
converted into Common Stock on the record date for the determination of holders of Common
Stock entitled to receive such dividend.

(b) Dividends may be declared and paid on Preferred Stock from funds lawfully
available therefor as and when determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(c) The holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as
declared by the Board of Directors, or upon liquidation or redemption as set forth herein, out of
any funds legally available therefor, preferential cumulative dividends in cash at the rate of eight
percent (8%) per share per annum of the stated value thereof. For such purpose, the "stated
value" of each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be $2.60, for each share of Series B
Preferred Stock shall be $1.85 and of each shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be $1.00
(which amount, in each case, shall be subject to equitable adjustment whenever there shall occur

to the Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock,
respectively). Such dividends shall be cumulative and shall accrue from the Original Issue Date
of the Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, as
applicable, whether or not earned or declared and whether or not in any fiscal year there shall be
net profits or surplus available for the payment of dividends in such fiscal year, so that if in any
fiscal year or years, such dividends are not paid in whole or in part upon the Preferred Stock, the
portion of such dividends as shall be unpaid shall accumulate as against the holders of the

(a) Series C Redemption. At the written election of holders of at least two-thirds
of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock made at any time on or after the date that is
90 days before the fifth anniversary of the Original Issue Date of the Series C Preferred Stock,
the Corporation shall be required to redeem all, but not less than all, of the outstanding shares of
Series C Preferred Stock in three equal annual installments, upon the terms set forth in this
Section 6 (the date of each installment being referred to as a “Series C Redemption Date”). On
each Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata basis in accordance with the
number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock owned by each holder, that number of outstanding
shares of Series C Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total number of shares of Series
C Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Series C Redemption Date by (ii) the
number of remaining Series C Redemption Dates (including the Series C Redemption Date to
which such calculation applies). On each such Series C Redemption Date, the holders of Series C
Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates for the shares to be redeemed duly
endorsed for transfer or with duly executed stock transfer powers sufficient to permit transfer
attached, at the offices of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Series C Preferred
Stock. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to each holder a
certificate or certificates for the balance of the shares not being redeemed. The redemption price
per share of Series C Preferred Stock, shall be equal to (i) $2.60 for the Series C Preferred Stock
(as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, reclassification or other
similar event with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock,) (the “Series C Base Redemption
Price”) plus all dividends accrued or declared but unpaid on such share on the applicable Series
C Redemption Date plus (ii) an additional amount computed like interest payable on the Series C
Base Redemption Price at the rate equal to simple interest of ten percent (10%) per annum from

legally available for redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock are insufficient to redeem the
number of shares of Series C Preferred required under this Subsection 6(a) to be redeemed on
such date from the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock making request, those funds which are
legally available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares of Series
C Preferred Stock. To the extent any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not redeemed on the
applicable Series C Redemption Date, the Corporation shall promptly return (or issue
replacement certificates) to the record holder of such Series C Preferred Stock. At any time
thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation become legally available for the redemption
of Series C Preferred Stock, such funds will be used to redeem the maximum number of
additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock which the Corporation was therertofore obligated to
redeem, on the basis set forth in the preceding sentence.

the Series C Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall be required to redeem all, but not less than
all, of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock in three equal annual installments, upon
the terms set forth in this Section 6 (the date of each installment being referred to as a “Series B
Redemption Date”). On each Series B Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a pro
rata basis in accordance with the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock owned by each
holder, that number of outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i)

23

the total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
Series B Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Series B Redemption Dates
(including the Series B Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). On each such Series
B Redemption Date, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificate or
certificates for the shares to be redeemed duly endorsed for transfer or with duly executed stock
transfer powers sufficient to permit transfer attached, at the offices of the Corporation or of any
transfer agent for the Series B Preferred Stock. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, issue and deliver to each holder a certificate or certificates for the balance of the
shares not being redeemed. The redemption price per share of Series B Preferred Stock, shall be

combination of shares, reclassification or other similar event with respect to the Series C
Preferred Stock,) (the “Series B Base Redemption Price”) plus all dividends accrued or declared
but unpaid on such share on the applicable Series B Redemption Date plus (ii) an additional
amount computed like interest payable on the Series B Base Redemption Price at the rate equal

Series B Preferred Stock. Subject to Subsection 6(a), if the funds of the Corporation legally
available for redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock are insufficient to redeem the number of
shares of Series B Preferred required under this Subsection 6(b) to be redeemed on such date
from the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock making request, those funds which are legally
available will be used to redeem the maximum possible number of such shares of Series B
Preferred Stock. To the extent any shares of Series B Preferred Stock are not redeemed on the
applicable Series B Redemption Date, the Corporation shall promptly return (or issue
replacement certificates) to the record holder of such Series B Preferred Stock. Subject to
Subsection 6(a), at any time thereafter when additional funds of the Corporation become legally
available for the redemption of Series B Preferred Stock, such funds will be used to redeem the
maximum number of additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock which the Corporation was
therertofore obligated to redeem, on the basis set forth in the preceding sentence.

(c) If at any time following the redemption in full of all shares of Series C
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock subject to a redemption request, the Corporation
receives written election of holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock made at any time on or after the date that is 90 days before the fifth anniversary
of the Original Issue Date of the Series C Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall be required to
redeem all, but not less than all, of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock in three
equal annual installments, upon the terms set forth in this Section 6 (the date of each installment
being referred to as a “Series A Redemption Date”). On each Series A Redemption Date, the
Corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of shares of Series
A Preferred Stock owned by each holder, that number of outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such Series A Redemption Date by (ii) the number of

Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates for the shares to be redeemed duly endorsed
for transfer or with duly executed stock transfer powers sufficient to permit transfer attached, at
the offices of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock. The

or certificates for the balance of the shares not being redeemed. The redemption price per share
of Series A Preferred Stock, shall be equal to (i) $1.00 for the Series A Preferred Stock (as
adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, reclassification or other
similar event with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock,) (the “Series A Base Redemption
Price’) plus all dividends accrued or declared but unpaid on such share on the applicable Series
A Redemption Date plus (ii) an additional amount computed like interest payable on the Series A
Base Redemption Price at the rate equal to simple interest of ten percent (10%) per annum from
the date of issuance of such share of Series A Preferred Stock. Subject to Subsections 6(a) and
(b), if the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of the Series A Preferred
Stock are insufficient to redeem the number of shares of Series A Preferred required under this
Subsection 6(c) to be redeemed on such date from the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
making request, those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the maximum
possible number of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock. To the extent any shares of Series A
Preferred Stock are not redeemed on the applicable Series A Redemption Date, the Corporation
shall promptly return (or issue replacement certificates) to the record holder of such Series A
Preferred Stock. Subject to Subsections 6(a) and (b), at any time thereafter when additional
funds of the Corporation become legally available for the redemption of Series A Preferred
Stock, such funds will be used to redeem the maximum number of additional shares of Series A
Preferred Stock which the Corporation was therertofore obligated to redeem, on the basis set
forth in the preceding sentence.

(d) Notice of redemption shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each
holder of record of the Series C Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred
Stock, as applicable, not less than thirty days nor more than sixty days prior to the first Series C
Redemption Date, Series B Redemption Date or Series A Redemption Date, as the case may be,
at the address of such holder as it appears on the books of the Corporation. Such notice shall set
forth (i) the applicable redemption dates; and (ii) the number of shares to be redeemed on each
date of redemption and the redemption price calculated in accordance with Subsections 6(a), (b)
or (c) above, on each such date. The Corporation shall be obligated to redeem the Series C
Preferred, Stock Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, on the
dates and in the amounts set forth in the notice; provided, however, that any holder of Series C
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock who is not party to a
redemption request with respect to such series of Preferred Stock may convert any or all of the
shares of such series of Preferred Stock owned by such holder into Common Stock in accordance
with Section 4 at any time prior to the date of redemption of such shares. The Corporation, if
advised before the close of business on the relevant redemption date by written notice from any
holder of record of Preferred Stock to be redeemed, shall credit against the number of shares of
Preferred Stock required to be redeemed from such holder, and shall not redeem, the number of
shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been converted by such holder on or before such date
and which shall not previously have been credited against any redemption.

(e) If, on or before a redemption date, the funds necessary for such redemption
shall have been set aside by the Corporation and deposited with a bank or trust company, in trust
for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the Preferred Stock that has been called for redemption,
then, notwithstanding that any certificates for shares that have been called for redemption shall
not have been surrendered for cancellation, the shares represented thereby shall no longer be

10748320_4.DOC
25

deemed outstanding from and after such redemption date, and all rights of holders of such shares
so called for redemption shall forthwith, after such redemption date, cease and terminate with
respect to such shares, excepting only the right to receive the redemption funds therefor to which
they are entitled. Any interest accrued on funds so deposited and unclaimed by stockholders
entitled thereto shall be paid to such stockholders at the time their respective shares are redeemed
or to the Corporation at the time unclaimed amounts are paid to it. In case the holders of shares
of Preferred Stock which shal] have been called for redemption shall not, within one year after
the final redemption date, claim the amounts so deposited with respect to the redemption thereof,
any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed
amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company shal] be relieved of all responsibility in
respect thereof to such holder and such holder shall look only to the Corporation for the payment
thereof. Any funds so deposited with a bank or trust company which shall not be required for
such redemption by reason of the exercise subsequent to the date of such deposit of the right of
conversion of any shares or otherwise shall be returned to the Corporation forthwith.

(f) If the Corporation for any reason fails to redeem any of the shares of Preferred
Stock in accordance with Subsection 6(a), (b), or (c) on or prior to the redemption dates
determined in accordance with this Section 6, then, the Corporation shall become obligated to
pay, in addition to the total redemption price specified in Subsections 6(a), (b) or (c), interest on
the unpaid balance of such price, which shall accrue at a rate equal to the lesser of (i) one percent
(1%) per month or (ii) the maximum interest rate allowable under applicable law, until such price
is paid in full.

Section 7. No Reissuance of Preferred Stock. No shares of Preferred Stock acquired by
the Corporation by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or otherwise shall be reissued,
and all such shares shall be canceled, retired and eliminated from the shares which the

courier service, addressed to the intended recipient at the recipient's address as it appears on the
