assets at the time legally available therefor, at the Dividend Rate specified for such shares of Preferred Stock
payable in preference and priority to any declaration or payment of any Distribution on Common Stock of the
Corporation in such calendar year. No Distributions shall be made with respect to the Common Stock until
all declared dividends on the Preferred Stock have been paid or set aside for payment to the Preferred Stock
holders, The right to receive dividends on shares of Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative, and no right to
such dividends shall accrue to holders of Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that dividends on said shares
are not declared or paid in any calendar year. If dividends are paid on any share of Common Stock pursuant

Stock in an amount per share equal to (on an as-converted-to-common stock basis) the amount paid or set
aside for each share of Common Stock.

-3-

(b) Common Stock. Dividends may be paid on the Common Stock when, as and if declared
by the Board of Directors, subject to the prior dividend rights of the Preferred Stock pursuant to ARTICLE V,
Section 2(a) above.

(c) Non-Cash Distributions. Whenever a Distribution provided for in this Section 2 shall be
payable in property other than cash, the value of such Distribution shall be deemed to be the fair market value
of such property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

3. Liquidation Rights.

(a) Liquidation Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary (a “Liquidation”), the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive, pari passu among each other and prior and in preference to any Distribution of any of the
assets of the Corporation to the holders of the Common Stock by reason of their ownership of such stock, an
amount per share for each share of Preferred Stock held by them equal to the sum of (i) the Liquidation
Preference specified for such share of Preferred Stock and (ii) all declared but unpaid dividends (if any) on
such share of Preferred Stock. If upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets
of the Corporation legally available for distribution to the holders of the Preferred Stock are insufficient to
permit the payment to such holders of the full amounts specified in this Section 3(a), then the entire assets of
the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among
the holders of the Preferred Stock in proportion to the full amounts they would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to this Section 3(a).

(b) Remaining Assets. Except as provided in Section 3(d), after the payment or setting aside
for payment to the holders of Preferred Stock of the full amounts specified in Section 3(a) above, the entire
remaining assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution shall be distributed pro rata to holders of
the Common Stock of the Corporation in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by them.

(c) Shares not Treated as Both Preferred Stock and Common Stock in any Distribution.
Shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be converted into shares of Common Stock in order to

participate in any Distribution, or series of Distributions, as shares of Common Stock, without first foregoing
participation in the Distribution, or series of Distributions, as shares of Preferred Stock.

(d) Reorganization. For purposes of this Section 3, unless otherwise determined by the
holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (pursuant to a
waiver of such holders’ liquidation rights under this Section 3, and voting as a single class on an as-converted
basis), a Liquidation shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, a Change of Control. A “Change of
Control” shall mean: (a) the acquisition of the Corporation by another entity by means of any transaction or
series of related transactions to which the Corporation is party (including, without limitation, any stock
acquisition, reorganization, merger or consolidation but excluding any sale of stock consummated principally
for capital raising purposes) other than a transaction or series of transactions in which the holders of the
voting securities of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such transaction continue to retain
(either by such voting securities remaining outstanding or by such voting securities being converted into
voting securities of the surviving entity), as a result of shares in the Corporation held by such holders prior to
such transaction, at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of
the Corporation or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such transaction or series of
transactions; or (b) a sale, exclusive license, lease or other conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Corporation. In the event of a Change of Control, upon the closing of such Change of
Control each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, for each share of Preferred Stock then held,
out of the proceeds of such Change of Control, the greater of the amount of cash, securities or other property

-4.

which such holder would be entitled to receive either (i) pursuant to Section 3(a) above, or (ii) if such holder
had converted such shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the closing
of such Change of Control.

(e) Valuation of Non-Cash Consideration. If any assets of the Corporation distributed to
stockholders in connection with any Liquidation are other than cash, then the value of such assets shall be
their fair market value as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

4. Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows:

(a) Right to Convert. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the
holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the Corporation or any
transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid, nonassessable shares of Common Stock
determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the relevant series by the Conversion Price for such series.
(The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Preferred Stock of a series may be
converted is hereinafter referred to as the “Conversion Rate” for each such series.) Upon any decrease or
increase in the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 4, the
Conversion Rate for such series shall be appropriately increased or decreased.

(b} Automatic Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted
into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate for such share
(i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering (“IPO”)
pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”), covering the offer and sale of the Corporation’s Common Stock, provided that the offering
price per share yields a pre-IPO valuation of the Corporation equal to or in excess of $100,000,000 and the
aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation exceed $20,000,000 (before deduction of underwriter
commissions and expenses), or (ii) upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such
conversion from the holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting
together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis, or, if later, the effective date for
conversion specified in such requests (each of the events referred to in (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as an
“Automatic Conversion Event”).

(c) Mechanics of Conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be
entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair market value of a
share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. For such purpose, all shares of Preferred
Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock then being converted into Common Stock shall be aggregated,
and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Before any holder of Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificates
therefor, he shall either (A) surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or (B) notify the Corporation or its transfer agent
that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates,
and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that he elects to convert the same; provided,
however, that on the date of an Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall
be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; and provided
further, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the certificates evidencing such
shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or the

-5-


holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed
and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss
incurred by it in connection with such certificates. On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion
Event, each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares
of Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the
Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or that the
certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such holder.

The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery of such certificates, or after such
agreement and indemnification, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate
or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as aforesaid and a
check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into
fractional shares of Common Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the converted Preferred Stock.
Such conversion (if other than in connection with an Automatic Conversion Event) shall be deemed to have
been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred
Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shal] be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with an underwritten
offer of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act or a merger, sale, financing, or liquidation of the
Corporation or other event, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering Preferred Stock for
conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of such transaction or upon the occurrence of such event, in
which case the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the
Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the
closing of such transaction or the occurrence of such event.

(d) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Diluting Issues.

(i) | Special Definition. For purposes of this paragraph 4(d), “Additional Shares
of Common” shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to paragraph 4(d\ii), deemed to be

Directors, not to exceed the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock reserved and authorized across all
such grants and/or plans as of the Filing Date (as appropriately adjusted for any Recapitalizations), or such

vote of holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class on an
as-converted basis);

(2) shares of Common Stock actually issued upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock;

(3) shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise or conversion of

Securities Act;

(6) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to the acquisition of
another corporation by the Corporation by merger, purchase of substantially all of the assets or other
reorganization or to a joint venture agreement, provided, that such issuances are approved by the holders of at
least a majority-in-interest of the Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis);

(7) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to banks, equipment lessors
or other financial institutions pursuant to a debt financing or commercial leasing transaction approved by the
Board of Directors and the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the Preferred Stock

as-converted basis);

(9) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with sponsored
research, collaboration, technology license, development, OEM, marketing or other similar agreements or
strategic partnerships or alliances approved by the Board of Directors and the affirmative vote of holders of at
feast a majority-in-interest of the Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis);

(10) — shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon exercise of
warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock issued in connection with bridge financings approved by the

(11) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to suppliers or third party
service providers in connection with the provision of goods or services pursuant to transactions approved by
the Board of Directors and the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the Preferred

shares of Series D Preferred Stock (x) issued pursuant to that certain Series D Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement dated as of March 19, 2012 by and among the Corporation and the Investors (as described
therein).

(ii) | Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Filing Date shall issue any Options or Convertible
Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to
receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the
instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible
Securities, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or, in the case of Options for
Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options and the conversion or exchange of the underlying

-7-


securities, shall be deemed to have been issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall
have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which
shares are deemed to be issued:

(1) no further adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred
Stock shall be made upon the subsequent issue of Convertible Securities or shares of Common Stock in
connection with the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;

(2) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide, with the
passage of time or otherwise, for any change in the consideration payable to the Corporation or in the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof (other than a change
pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of such Options or Convertible Securities such as this Section 4(d) or
pursuant to Recapitalization provisions of such Options or Convertible Securities such as Sections 4(e), 4(f)
and 4(g) hereof), the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock and any subsequent adjustments
based thereon shall be recomputed to reflect such change as if such change had been in effect as of the
original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of the record date with respect thereto);

(3) no readjustment pursuant to clause (2) above shall have the effect of
increasing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock to an amount above the Conversion Price that
would have resulted from any other issuances of Additional Shares of Common and any other adjustments
provided for herein between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date;

(4) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of conversion or
exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the Conversion Price of
each series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record
date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration, be
recomputed as if:

(a) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for Common
Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually
issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and the
consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of
such exercised Options plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for
the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional
consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and

(b) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the
Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of issue of
such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of Common
deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of
such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined
pursuant to Section 4(d){iv)) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options
were actually exercised; and

(5) if such record date shall have been fixed and such Options or Convertible
Securities are not issued on the date fixed therefor, the adjustment previously made in the Conversion Price
which became effective on such record date shall be canceled as of the close of business on such record date,
and thereafter the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph 4(d)(ii) as of the actual date of
their issuance.

(iii) | Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of
Common. In the event this Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (including Additional

Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to paragraph 4(d)(ii)) without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock in effect on the
date of and immediately prior to such issue, then, the Conversion Price of the affected series of Preferred
Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares which the aggregate
consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued
would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of
Common so issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be reduced at such time if
the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01, but any such amount shall be carried forward, and a
reduction will be made with respect to such amount at the time of, and together with, any subsequent
reduction which, together with such amount and any other amounts so carried forward, equal $0.01 or more in
the aggregate. For the purposes of this Subsection 4(d)(iii), all shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and the exercise and/or conversion of any other
outstanding Convertible Securities and all outstanding Options shall be deemed to be outstanding.

(iv) Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this subsection 4(d), the
consideration received by the Corporation for the issue (or deemed issue) of any Additional Shares of
Common shall be computed as follows:

(1) Cash and Property. Such consideration shall:

(a) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation before deducting any reasonable discounts, commissions or other
expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with
such issuance;

(b) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed at
the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors;
and

(c) in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued together
with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which covers both, be the
proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a) and (b) above, as
reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

(2) Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share
received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued pursuant to
paragraph 4(d)(ii) shall be determined by dividing:

(x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as
consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of
additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision
contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the
exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of
Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion
or exchange of such Convertible Securities by

-9-


(y) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the
instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of
such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities.

(ec) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock. In the event the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or

otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock without a corresponding subdivision of the
Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such
subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In
the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a
lesser number of shares of Common Stock without a corresponding combination of the Preferred Stock, the
Conversion Prices in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness
of such combination, be proportionately increased.

(f) Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock. In the event the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by
payment of a stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Preferred Stock without a
corresponding subdivision of the Common Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation
Preference of the affected series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or
otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Preferred Stock without a corresponding combination of the
Common Stock, the Dividend Rate, Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected series of
Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of
such combination, be proportionately increased.

(g) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. Subject to Section 3 above
(“Liquidation Rights”), if the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be
changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by
capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares
provided for above), then, in any such event, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the
holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive each holder of such Preferred Stock shall have the right
thereafter to convert such shares of Preferred Stock into a number of shares of such other class or classes of
stock which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such series of
Preferred Stock immediately before that change would have been entitled to receive in such reorganization or
reclassification, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein with respect to such other shares.

(h) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment
of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such
adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock
a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon the request at any time of any holder of
Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such
adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of
Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the
conversion of Preferred Stock.

(i) Waiver of Adjustment of Conversion Price. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any downward adjustment of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock may be waived

of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock
as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred
Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will
take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

on all matters on which the Common Stock shall be entitled to vote. Holders of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation. Fractional
votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula (after
aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted), shall be

an as-converted basis) shall be entitled to elect three (3) members of the Corporation’s Board of Directors at
each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Corporation's stockholders for the election of directors (each

two (2) members of the Corporation’s Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the
Corporation's stockholders for the election of directors (each a “Common Director”). Any additional
members of the Corporation’s Board of Directors shall be mutually elected by the holders of at least a
majority-in-interest of the then outstanding Common Stock and the holders of at feast a majority-in-interest of
the then outstanding Preferred Stock, each voting as a separate class and, with respect to the holders of
Preferred Stock, together as a single class and on an as-converted to Common Stock basis (each a “Mutual

elected by the same class or classes of stockholders as those who would be entitled to vote to fill such
vacancy shall vote to fill such vacancy.
