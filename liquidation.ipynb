Such conversion ‘shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of the Preferred Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date; provided, however, that if the conversion is in connection with a public offering or a Liquidation Event, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering the Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing of the sale of securities pursuant to such public offering, or such Liquidation Event, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing or consummation of the public offering or Liquidation Event.; (B) No adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price shall be made if the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01.; (e) Adjustments to Conversion Price for Certain Combinations, Distributions, Reclassifications and Reorganizations.; (ii) Adjustments for Other Distributions.; In the event the Company at any time or from time to time makes or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive any Distribution payable in securities of the Company, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall receive upon such Distribution the amount of securities of the Company which they would have received had their Preferred Stock converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had they thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the date of conversion, retained such securities receivable by them as aforesaid during  4762562_8 , -12- such period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under this Section 4 with respect to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock.; If the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a-subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), the Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or teclassification, be proportionately adjusted such that.the Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately before that change.; If at any time or from time to time, there is a capital reorganization of the Common Stock-or the merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation or another entity or person (other than an Acquisition or Asset Transfer as defined in Section 3(d) or a recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or substitution of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 4), as a part of such capital reorganization, merger or consolidation, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock held by them the number of shares of stock or other securities or property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such capital reorganization, merger or consolidation.; In the event that the Company shall propose at any time: (i) to declare any dividend or Distribution upon its Common Stock, whether in  cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and whether or not out of earnings or earned surplus;  4762562_8 -13- (ii) to offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of any class or series of its stock (other than pursuant to contractual agreements entered into with each such holder) any additional shares of stock of any class or series or any other securities or property, or to receive any other rights; .; (iii) to effect any Reclassification or other recapitalization of its Common Stock outstanding involving a change in the Common Stock; or  (iv) to merge or consolidate with or'into any other corporation, or sell, lease or convey all or substantially all its property or business, or to liquidate, dissolve or wind up (other than in connection with a merger, the sole purpose of which is to change the state of the Company’s incorporation);  then, in connection with each such event, the Company shall send to the holders of the Preferred Stock at least 10 calendar days’ prior written notice of the earlier of (A) the date on which a record shall be taken for such dividend, Distribution or subscription rights (and specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto) or for determining rights to vote in respect of the matters referred to in (iii) and (iv) above or (B) the closing date of such event; provided, however, the notice provisions set forth in this section may be shortened or waived by the vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class.; Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion.; Each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder of the Preferred Stock could then be converted.; Except as provided in Subsection 5(c) below, the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters on which the Common Stock shall be entitled to vote and may act by written consent in the same manner as the holders of Common Stock.; The holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any shareholders’ meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Company, Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula (after aggregating all shares into which shares of the Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted), shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).; (b) Common Stock.; Except as otherwise required by law, each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share thereof held.; The holders of Common Stock and the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cumulative voting rights as to the directors to be elected by each class or the combined classes, in accordance with the provisions of Section 708 of the California Corporations Code.; So long as at least 5,000,000 shares (as adjusted for Recapitalizations) of the Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, respectively, each voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to each elect one (1) member of the Company’s Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s shareholders for the election of directors.; In the case of any vacancy in the office of a director elected by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, as the case may be, the holders of the then outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, as the case may be, shall be entitled, voting as a separate class either by written consent or at a special meeting, to elect a successor to hold office for the unexpired term of the director whose place shall be vacant.; The holders of Common Stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect two (2) members of the Company’s Board of Directors at each meeting or pursuant to each consent of the Company’s shareholders for the election of directors.; In the case of any vacancy in the office of a director elected by the holders of Common Stock, the holders of the then outstanding Common Stock shall be entitled, voting as a separate class either by written consent or at a special meeting, to elect a successor to hold office for the unexpired term of the director whose place shall be vacant.; For so long as at least 3,500,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding (as adjusted for Recapitalizations), the Company shall not, (directly or indirectly, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent as provided by law) of the holders of at least a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock:  G) amend, alter or repeal any provision of the Fourth Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company in a way that adversely affects the rights, preferences, privileges or powers of, or restrictions provided for the benefit of, the Series D Preferred Stock in a different manner than the other series of Preferred Stock, including without limitation any amendment that deprives the Series D of its senior liquidation preference or accrued dividend right, even if the liquidation and dividend rights of all Preferred Stock is being reduced or removed; or  (ii) reclassify, alter or amend the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and/or Series D Preferred Stock in respect of the distribution of assets upon a Liquidation Event, if such reclassification, alteration or amendment would render such Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and/or Series C Preferred Stock senior to or pari passu with the Series D Preferred Stock in respect of any such preference.;
