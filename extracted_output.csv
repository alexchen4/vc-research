In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock, at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates.; The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Date, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to his or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share.;

and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation.; Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.; All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon.;

If the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the  same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend provided for above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale of assets provided for below), then and in each such event the holder of each such share of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable, upon such reorganization, reclassification, or other change, by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification, or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.; In case of any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation or the sale of all or  substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another corporation, each share of Preferred Stock, ifany, remaining outstanding after such consolidation, merger or sale shall thereafter be convertible (or shall be converted into a security which shall be convertible) into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or cash or other property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock would have been entitled upon such consolidation, merger or sale; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 4 set forth with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the holders of the Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as  7980393.;

All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be given written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock, pursuant to this SectionS.; Such notice shall be sent to each record holder of Preferred Stock at such holder’s address last shown on the records of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or the records of the Corporation, if it serves as its own transfer agent).; Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice.; On the Mandatory Conversion Date, each holder of record or shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of such Preferred Stock, or that the  7980393_4.doc  18 certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such holder.;

Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined (i) in the case of Series A Preferred Stock by dividing $1.00 by the Series A Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion, (ii) in the case of Series A-1 Preferred Stock by dividing $1.50 by the Series A-1 Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion, (iii) in the case of Series B Preferred Stock by dividing $2.078192 by the Series B Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion, (iv) in the case of Series B-1 Preferred Stock by dividing $3.33 by the Series B-1 Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion, (v) in the case of the Series C Preferred Stock by dividing $3.371016 by the Series C Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion, (vi) in the case of the Series D Preferred Stock by dividing $6.56063 by the Series D Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion and (vii) in the case of the Series E Preferred Stock by dividing $16.5923 by the Series E Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion.; Such initial Series A, Series A-1, Series B, Series B-1, Series C, Series D and Series E Conversion Prices, and the rate at which shares of Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided below.; (i) In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock, at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates.; The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Date, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to his or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share.; (ii) The Corporation shall at all times when the Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock.; (iv) All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote as a holder of Preferred Stock, shall immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon.;

In addition, notwithstanding the above, and with respect to Series E Preferred Stock only, in no event shall the conversion of shares of Series E Preferred Stock be effected without the vote or written consent of the holders of at least 68% of the then outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock other than (i) pursuant to a Qualifying Public Offering or (ii) pursuant to and in connection with a Liquidation Event in which the Liquidation Proceeds are greater than or equal to an amount which would result in holders of Series E Preferred Stock receiving in such Liquidation Event an amount equal to or greater than $16.5923 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, recapitalizations and other similar events affecting such shares), of Series E Preferred Stock.; (b) All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be given written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5.; Such notice shall be sent by first class or registered mail, postage prepaid, to each record holder of Preferred Stock at such holder's address last shown on the records of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or the records of the Corporation, if it serves as its own transfer agent).; Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his or its certificate or certificates for all such shares to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 5.; (c) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after the Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date.; Such converted Preferred Stock may not be reissued, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly.; Shares of Senior Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the Corporation at a price equal to (1) $1.00 per share with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other recapitalization affecting such Series A Preferred Stock) (the ""Series A Redemption Price""), (ii) $1.50 per share with respect to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other recapitalization affecting such Series A-1 Preferred Stock) (the ""Series A-1 Redemption Price""), (iii) $2.078192 per share with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other recapitalization affecting such Series B Preferred Stock) (the ""Series B Redemption Price""), (iv) $3.371016 per share with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other recapitalization affecting such Series C Preferred Stock) (the ""Series C Redemption Price""), (v) $6.56063 per share with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other recapitalization affecting such Series D Preferred Stock) (the ""Series D Redemption Price"") and (vi) $16.5923 per share with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other recapitalization affecting such Series E Preferred Stock) (the ""Series E Redemption Price""), in three annual installments commencing 60 days after receipt by the Corporation at any time on or after May 6, 2013 from the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (667/3%) of the then outstanding shares of Senior Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, of written notice requesting redemption of all shares of Senior Preferred Stock (the date of each such installment being referred to as a ""Redemption Date"").;

(iv) The Company shall give each holder of record of Preferred Stock written notice of such impending transaction not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the stockholders’ meeting called to approve such transaction, or fifteen (15) days prior to the closing of such transaction, whichever is earlier, and shall also notify such holders in writing of the final approval of such transaction.; In connection with any proposed Acquisition transaction, holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to conditionally convert their shares of Preferred Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as provided in Section B.4 of this Article IV contingent upon the consummation of the Acquisition; it being the intent of this Section that holders of Preferred Stock be given the opportunity to maximize the return on their investment in the event that they convert their shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock and not to require the holders of Preferred Stock to convert if, for any reason, the Acquisition provided for in the notice to the holders of Preferred Stock is not consummated.; (v) | Shares of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to be converted into shares of Common Stock in order to participate in any distribution, or series of distributions, as shares of Common Stock, without first foregoing participation in the distribution, or series of distributions, as shares of Preferred Stock.;

On the Redemption Date, the Company shall redeem all shares of Series E Preferred Stock that have been requested to be redeemed outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date.; If the Company does not have sufficient funds legally permissible for redemption on the Redemption Date of all shares of Series E Preferred Stock, the Company shall redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s redeemable shares of such capital stock out of funds legally permissible for redemption, based on the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares to be redeemed if the legally permissible funds were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and shall redeem the remaining shares to have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Company has funds legally permissible for redemption.; If the Redemption Notice shall have been duly given, and if on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon redemption of the shares of Preferred Stock is paid or tendered for payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available therefor, then notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered, all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith after the Redemption Date terminate, except only the right of the holders to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of their certificate or certificates therefor.; Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, and on or prior to the fifth day prior to the Redemption Date, if any, as may have been fixed in any Redemption Notice with respect to such share of the Series E Preferred Stock, at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock, as the case may be, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Series A Issue Price, Original Series B Issue Price, Original Series C Issue Price, Original Series D Issue Price or Original Series E Issue Price, as the case may be (in each case as defined in Section B.2 above) by the Conversion Price applicable to the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock, as the case may be, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion.; The initial “Conversion Price” per share for shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series A Issue Price, the initial “Conversion Price” per share for shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series B Issue Price, the initial “Conversion Price” per share for shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series C Issue Price, the initial “Conversion Price” per share for shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series D Issue Price and the initial “Conversion Price” per share for shares  GDS VF&H\824755.7 8 of Series E Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series E Issue Price; provided, however, that the Conversion Prices for the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 4(d).; (i) Each share of Series E Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the Conversion Price at the time in effect for each such series of Preferred Stock, immediately upon the earlier of (i) except as provided below in subsection 4(c), the closing of the sale by the Company of Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act’), other than a registration relating solely to a transaction under Rule 145 under the Securities Act (or any successor thereto) or to an employee benefit plan of the Company, that results in gross offering proceeds (before deduction of underwriters’ discounts and commissions and expenses) to the Company and/or any selling stockholders of more than $30,000,000 in the aggregate and a per share public offering price of at least $9.00 (subject to adjustment to reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits, stock combinations or other recapitalizations) (a “Qualified Public Offering”) or (ii) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class and not as separate series and on an as- converted basis).;

(i) Before any holder of a series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or  GDSVF&EN824755,7 9 names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued; provided, however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to subsection 4(b), the outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holder of such shares and whether or not the certificate representing such shares is surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, further, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable’upon such automatic conversion unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.; The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the surrender by a holder of the certificate representing shares of the Preferred Stock in accordance with this subsection 4(c), issue and deliver at such office to such holder of such series of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid.; (ii) | If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering shares of such series of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of such series of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such shares of such series of Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.; (iii) If the conversion occurs through the vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of one or more classes of Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class and not as a separate series and on an as-converted basis) pursuant to subsection (b), such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the day written notice of such election has been received by the Company, and the person or persons entitled to receive shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.; Until certificates for such shares of Preferred-Stock of the applicable classes that have been converted have been delivered to the Company for exchange for certificates representing shares of Common Stock, such certificates shall be deemed to represent the shares of Common Stock into which such shares of the applicable classes of Preferred Stock have been converted,  (d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations, The Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred  GDSVE&H\824755.7 10 Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series D Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:  (i) (A) If the Company shall issue, after the date upon which any share of Series E Preferred Stock was first issued (the “Purchase Date”), any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and/or Series E Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and/or Series E Preferred Stock, as appropriate, in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.; Except to the limited extent provided for in subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(3) and 4(d)@)(E)(4) below, no adjustment of such Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock above the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.; (ii) “Additional Stock” with respect to any series of Preferred Stock shall mean any shares of Common Stock issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to subsection 4(d)(i)(E)) by the Company after the Purchase Date other than:  (A) Common Stock issued pursuant to a transaction described in subsection 4(d)(iii) hereof,  (B) shares of Common Stock issuable or issued to directors, officers, or employees of, or consultants, or other service providers to the Company directly or pursuant to a stock option, stock bonus, stock purchase or restricted stock plan or agreement or warrants approved by the Board of Directors of the Company;

(iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of  GDSVF&MN824755.7 14 Common Stock and without a corresponding combination of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.; (v) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the operation of, and any adjustment of the Conversion Prices pursuant to, the provisions of subsection 4(d){i) may be waived with respect to any specific share or shares of Preferred Stock, either prospectively or retroactively and either generally or in a particular instance by a writing executed by the registered holder of such share or shares.;

The initial Conversion Price per share for the shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series B-3 Issue Price, the Original Series B-2 Issue Price, the initial Conversion Price per share for the shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series B-1 Issue Price, the initial Conversion Price per share for shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series A-1 Issue Price, and the initial Conversion Price per share for shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock shall be the Original Series A-2 Issue Price;

(i) Before any holder of a series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for such series of Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or  ACTIVE/94266238,2 7 names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued; provided, however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to subsection 4(b), the outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holder of such shares and whether or not the certificate representing such shares is surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, further, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.; The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the surrender by a holder of the certificate representing shares of the Preferred Stock in accordance with this subsection 4(c), issue and deliver at such office to such holder of such series of Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid.; (ii) If the conversion is in connection with an underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Act, the conversion may, at the option of any holder tendering shares of such series of Preferred Stock for conversion, be conditioned upon the closing with the underwriters of the sale of securities pursuant to such offering, in which event the person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of such series of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such shares of such series of Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of such sale of securities.; Until certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock of the applicable classes that have been converted have been delivered to the Company for exchange for certificates representing shares of Common Stock, such certificates shall be deemed to represent the shares of Common Stock into which such shares of the applicable classes of Preferred Stock have been converted.; (d) Conversion Price Adjustments of Preferred Stock for Certain Dilutive Issuances, Splits and Combinations.; The Conversion Price of the Series B-3 Preferred Stock, the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:  (i)  ACTIVE/94266238,2 8 (A) Ifthe Company shall issue, on or after the date upon which this Restated Certificate of Incorporation is accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Filing Date”), any Additional Stock (as defined below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price for the Series B-3 Preferred Stock, the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock (as defined below), the Conversion Price for the Series B-3 Preferred Stock, the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock or Series A-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall forthwith (except as otherwise provided in this clause (i)) be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for such issuance would purchase at such Conversion Price; and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.; For the purpose of the foregoing calculation, the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance shall be calculated on a fully diluted basis, as if all shares of Preferred Stock and all other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (“Convertible Securities”) had been fully converted into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such issuance and any currently exercisable warrants, options or other rights for the purchase of shares of stock or convertible securities had been fully exercised immediately prior to such issuance (and the resulting securities fully converted into shares of Common Stock, if so convertible), but not including in such calculation any additional shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to shares of Preferred Stock, Convertible Securities, or currently exercisable options, warrants or other rights for the purchase of shares of stock or Convertible Securities, solely as a result of the adjustment of such Conversion Price for the Series B-3 Preferred Stock, the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock (or other conversion ratios) resulting from the issuance of Additional Stock causing such adjustment.; Except to the limited extent provided for in subsections 4(d)(i)(E)(3) and 4(d)(@)(E)(4) below, no adjustment of the Conversion Price for the Series B-3 Preferred Stock, the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(i) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price for the Series B-3 Preferred Stock, the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, the Series B-1 Preferred Stock or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock above the Conversion Price for the Series B-3 Preferred Stock, the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, the Series B-1  ACTIVE/94266238,2 9 Preferred Stock or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.; ACTIVE/94266238,2 12 (iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time after the Filing Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and without a corresponding combination of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.; Any waiver pursuant to this subsection 4(d)(v) shall bind all future holders of the shares of Preferred Stock for which rights have been waived.; In the event that a waiver of adjustment of Conversion Price under this subsection 4(d)(v) results in different Conversion Prices for shares of a series of Preferred Stock, the Secretary of this company shall maintain a written ledger identifying the Conversion Price for each share of such series of Preferred Stock.; (e) Other Distributions, In the event the Company shall declare a distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Company or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in subsection 4(d)(iii), without a corresponding distribution to the Preferred Stock, then, in each such case for the purpose of this subsection 4(e), the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution.; Gi) If any consolidation or merger of the Company with another company or entity shall be effected, then, as a condition of such consolidation or merger, lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein, and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore receivable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or payable in connection with such consolidation or merger with respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consolidation or merger.; The Company shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of  ACTIVE/94266238,2 14 Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the consideration received or deemed to be received by the Company for any Additional Stock issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold, (C) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (D) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Preferred Stock.;

 (iii) liquidate, dissolve or wind up the Company or consummate an Acquisition;  (iv) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire (or pay into or set aside for a sinking fund for such purpose), directly or indirectly, any share or shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock;

Any share or shares of Preferred Stock acquired by the Company by reason of redemption, purchase, conversion or  otherwise shall be retired and have the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to series until such shares are once more designated as part of a particular series by the Board of Directors.;

The initial Conversion Price per share for each series of Preferred Stock shall be the Original Issue Price applicable to such series; provided, however, that the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 4(d).; Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate at the time in effect for such  899133 v4/HN series of Preferred Stock immediately upon the earlier of (i) the Corporation’s sale of its Common Stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering, pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), where the public offering price is not less than three times the Original Issue Price for the Series C Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock) and results in aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation (before underwriting discounts, commissions and fees) of at least thirty million dollars ($30,000,000) and the Common Stock of the Corporation is listed for trading on the TSX, NYSE, NASDAQ or other recognized stock exchange acceptable to the holders of at least seventy percent (70%) of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (a “Qualifying IPO”) or (ii) the date specified by written consent or written agreement of the holders of at least seventy percent (70%) of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock (voting as a separate class).;

and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock.; (iv) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Price for the Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.;

If at any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 4 or Section 2) provision shall be made so that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled on such recapitalization.; The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property that at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Preferred Stock.; The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,  solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate.;

All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon.;

In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock, at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates.; The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Date, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to his or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share.; On the Conversion Date, each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock, notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such holder.; The Corporation shall at all times when Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation.; Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.; All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and to vote, shall immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon.;

If the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the  same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend provided for above, or a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale of assets provided for below), then and in each such event the holder of each such share of Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable, upon such reorganization, reclassification, or other change, by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification, or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.; In case of any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation or the sale of all or  substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another corporation, each share of Preferred Stock, if any, remaining outstanding after such consolidation, merger or sale shall thereafter be convertible (or shall be converted into a security which shall be convertible) into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or cash or other property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation deliverable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock would have been entitled upon such consolidation, merger or sale; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 4 set forth with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the holders of the Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly equivalent a manner as may be practicable as before the consolidation or merger.; Upon (1) the vote of the holders of a majority of the Series D Preferred Stock and Series D-1 Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class and the vote of the holders of a majority of the Series C Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class, or (ii) the closing of a Qualified Public Offering (as defined below), all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into shares of Common Stock into which such Preferred Stock is convertible pursuant to Section 4 above and such shares of Preferred Stock may not be reissued by the Corporation.; All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be given written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock, pursuant to this Section 5.; Such notice shall be sent to each record holder of Preferred Stock at such holder’s address last shown on the records of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or the records of the Corporation, if it serves as its own transfer agent).; Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice.; On the Mandatory Conversion Date, each holder of record or shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of such Preferred Stock, or that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such holder.; (d) All certificates evidencing shares of Preferred Stock which are required to be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof shall, from and after the Mandatory Conversion Date, be deemed to have been retired and cancelled and the shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender such certificates on or prior to such date.;
